It is very safe when carried out using a method recommended by WHO, appropriate to the pregnancy duration and by someone with the necessary skills. However, around 45% of abortions are unsafe. Unsafe abortion is an important preventable cause of maternal deaths and morbidities. It can lead to physical and mental health complications and social and financial burdens for women, communities and health systems. Lack of access to safe, timely, affordable and respectful abortion care is a critical public health and human rights issue..",

Six out of 10 (61%) of all unintended pregnancies, and 3 out of 10 (29%) of all pregnancies, end in induced abortion(1). Comprehensive abortion care is included in thelist of essential health care servicespublished by WHO in 2020. Abortion is a simple health care intervention that can be safely and effectively managed by a wide range of health workers using medication or a surgical procedure. In the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, a medical abortion can also be safely self-managed by the pregnant person outside of a health care facility (e.g. at home), in whole or in part. This requires that the woman has access to accurate information, quality medicines and support from a trained health worker (if she needs or wants it during the process). Comprehensive abortion care includes the provision of information, abortion management and post-abortion care. It encompasses care related to miscarriage (spontaneous abortion and missed abortion), induced abortion (the deliberate interruption of an ongoing pregnancy by medical or surgical means), incomplete abortion as well as intrauterine fetal demise. The information in this fact sheet focuses on care related to induced abortion..",

    "text": "WHO provides global technical and policy guidance on the use of contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy, provision of information on abortion care, abortion management (including miscarriage, induced abortion, incomplete abortion and fetal death) and post-abortion care. In 2022, WHO published an updated, consolidated guideline on abortion care, including all WHO recommendations and best practice statements across three domains essential to the provision of abortion care: law and policy, clinical services and service delivery. WHO also maintains theGlobal Abortion Policies Database. This interactive online database contains comprehensive information on the abortion laws, policies, health standards and guidelines for all countries. Upon request, WHO provides technical support to countries to adapt sexual and reproductive health guidelines to specific contexts and strengthen national policies and programmes related to contraception and safe abortion care. A quality abortion care monitoring and evaluation framework is also in development. WHO is a cosponsor of theHRP (UNDPUNFPAUNICEFWHOWorld Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction), which carries out research on clinical care, abortion regulation, abortion stigma, as well as implementation research on community and health systems approaches to quality abortion care. It also monitors the global burden of unsafe abortion and its consequences. 1An unsafe abortion is defined as a procedure for terminating a pregnancy performed by persons lacking the necessary information or skills or in an environment not in conformity with minimal medical standards, or both. The persons, skills and medical standards considered safe in the provision of abortion are different for medical and surgical abortion and by pregnancy duration. In using this definition, what is considered safe or unsafe needs to be interpreted in line with the most current WHO technical and policy guidance(2).

It is vital to address the determinants that drive the acceptability, availability and affordability of alcohol consumption through cross-sectoral, comprehensive and integrated policy measures. It is also of critical importance to achieve universal health coverage for people living with alcohol use disorders and other health conditions due to alcohol use by strengthening health system responses and developing comprehensive and accessible systems of treatment and care that for those in need. The SAFER initiative, launched in 2018 by WHO and partners, supports countries to implement the high-impact, cost-effective interventions proven to reduce the harm caused by alcohol consumption. The WHO Global Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH) presents data on levels and patterns of alcohol consumption, alcohol-attributable health and social consequences and policy responses across the world. Achieving a reduction in the harmful use of alcohol in line with the targets included in the Global alcohol action plan, the SDG 2030 agenda and the WHO Global monitoring framework for noncommunicable diseases, requires concerted action by countries and effective global governance. Public policies and interventions to prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm should be guided and formulated by public health interests and based on clear public health goals and the best available evidence. Engaging all relevant stakeholders is essential but the potential conflicts of interest, particularly with the alcohol industry, must be carefully assessed before engagement. Economic operators should refrain from activities that might prevent, delay or stop the development, enactment, implementation and enforcement of high-impact strategies and interventions to reduce the harmful use of alcohol.",

It is considered a symptom of an underlying condition(s). Anaemia may be caused by several factors: nutrient deficiencies, inadequate diet (or the inadequate absorption of nutrients), infections, inflammation, chronic diseases, gynaecological and obstetric conditions, and inherited red blood cell disorders. Iron deficiency, primarily due to inadequate dietary iron intake, is considered the most common nutritional deficiency leading to anaemia. Deficiencies in vitamin A, folate, vitamin B12 and riboflavin can also result in anaemia due to their specific roles in the synthesis of haemoglobin andor erythrocyte production. Additional mechanisms include nutrient losses (e.g. blood loss from parasitic infections, haemorrhage associated with childbirth, or menstrual loss), impaired absorption, low iron stores at birth, and nutrient interactions affecting iron bioavailability. Infections can be another important cause of anaemia, depending on the local burden of infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and parasitic infections. Infections can impair nutrient absorption and metabolism (e.g. malaria, ascariasis) or can cause nutrient loss (e.g. schistosomiasis, hookworm infection). Many different chronic conditions can cause inflammation and lead to anaemia of inflammation or anaemia of chronic disease. HIV infection causes anaemia through a wide range of mechanisms including ineffective production or excessive destruction of red blood cells, blood loss, and side effects of the drug treatment. Consistent heavy menstrual losses, maternal blood volume expansion during pregnancy, and blood loss during and after childbirth, particularly in cases of postpartum haemorrhage, commonly lead to anaemia. Additionally, in some regions, inherited red blood cell disorders are a common cause of anaemia. These include conditions such as \u03b1- and \u03b2-thalassemia due to abnormalities of haemoglobin synthesis, sickle cell disorders due to changes in the haemoglobin structure, other haemoglobinopathies due to haemoglobin gene variants, abnormalities of red cell enzymes, or abnormalities of the red blood cell membrane..",

It is estimated that bacterial AMR was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019 and contributed to 4.95 million deaths(1). The misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in humans, animals and plants are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant pathogens. AMR affects countries in all regions and at all income levels. Its drivers and consequences are exacerbated by poverty and inequality, and low- and middle-income countries are most affected. AMR puts many of the gains of modern medicine at risk. It makes infections harder to treat and makes other medical procedures and treatments  such as surgery, caesarean sections and cancer chemotherapy  much riskier. The world faces an antibiotics pipeline and access crisis. There is an inadequate research and development pipeline in the face of rising levels of resistance, and urgent need for additional measures to ensure equitable access to new and existing vaccines, diagnostics and medicines. In addition to death and disability, AMR has significant economic costs. The World Bank estimates that AMR could result in US 1 trillion additional healthcare costs by 2050, and US 1 trillion to US 3.4 trillion gross domestic product (GDP) losses per year by 2030(2). Priorities to address AMR in human health include preventing all infections, which may result in inappropriate use of antimicrobials; ensuring universal access to quality diagnosis and appropriate treatment of infections; and strategic information and innovation, for example surveillance of AMR and antimicrobial consumptionuse, and research and development for novel vaccines, diagnostics and medicines..",

There are several different kinds of anxiety disorders, including: generalized anxiety disorder (persistent and excessive worry about daily activities or events); panic disorder (panic attacks and fear of continued panic attacks); social anxiety disorder (high levels of fear and worry about social situations that might make the person feel humiliated, embarrassed or rejected); agoraphobia (excessive fear, worry and avoidance of situations that might cause a person to panic or feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed); separation anxiety disorder (excessive fear or worry about being separated from people with whom the person has a deep emotional bond); specific phobias (intense, irrational fears of specific objects or situations that lead to avoidance behaviour and significant distress); and selective mutism (consistent inability to speak in certain social situations, despite the ability to speak comfortably in other settings, primarily affecting children). People may experience more than one anxiety disorder at the same time. Symptoms often begin during childhood or adolescence and continue into adulthood. Girls and women are more likely to experience an anxiety disorder than boys and men..",

    "text": "There are several effective treatments for anxiety disorders. People with symptoms of anxiety should seek care. Psychological interventionsare essential treatments for anxiety disorders and refer primarily to talk therapy with professionals or supervised lay therapists. These interventions can help people learn new ways of thinking, coping or relating to their anxiety, to others or to the world. They can teach people how to face the situations, events, people or places that trigger their anxiety. Psychological interventions can be provided to individuals or groups, in person or online. They may also be accessed through self-help manuals, websites and apps. The psychological interventions with the most evidence for treating a range of anxiety disorders are those based on principles of cognitive-behavioural therapy. These include exposure therapy, during which people learn to face their fears. In addition, learning stress management skills, such as relaxation skills and mindfulness skills, can help reduce symptoms of anxiety disorders. Antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can also be useful in treating adults with anxiety disorders. Health-care providers should keep in mind the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication, the ability to deliver either intervention (in terms of expertise, andor treatment availability), and individual preferences. Benzodiazepines, which have historically been prescribed for anxiety disorders, are generally not recommended for anxiety disorders because of their high potential for dependence as well as their limited long-term effectiveness..",

WHOs work to reduce arsenic exposure includes setting guideline values, reviewing evidence and providing risk management recommendations. WHO publishes a guideline value for arsenic in itsGuidelines for drinking-water quality. The Guidelines are intended for use as the basis for regulation and standard setting worldwide. The current recommended limit of arsenic in drinking-water is 10 \u03bcgL, although this guideline value is designated as provisional because of practical difficulties in removing arsenic from drinking-water. Every effort should therefore be made to keep concentrations as low as reasonably possible and below the guideline value when resources are available. However, millions of people around the world are exposed to arsenic at concentrations much higher than the guideline value (100 \u03bcgL or greater), and therefore the public health priority should be to reduce exposure for these people. Where it is difficult to achieve the guideline value, Member States may set higher limits or interim values as part of an overall strategy to progressively reduce risks, while taking into account local circumstances, available resources, and risks from low arsenic sources that are contaminated microbiologically. The WHOUNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene monitors progress towards global targets on drinking water. Under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the indicator of safely managed drinking water services calls for tracking the population accessing drinking water which is free of faecal contamination and priority chemical contaminants, including arsenic. -- References (1)Association of arsenic with adverse pregnancy outcomesinfant mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis.Quansah R, Armah FA, Essumang DK, Luginaah I, Clarke E, Marfoh K, et al.

Because of its use in building materials, anyone engaging in construction, maintenance and demolition of buildings where asbestos has been used is potentially at risk, even many years or decades after the asbestos was put in place. Asbestos-related diseases can be prevented, and the most efficient way to prevent them is to stop the use of all forms of asbestos to prevent exposure, as more than 50 WHO Member States have already done through legal measures, and to use low hazard materials instead.

Inhalers can help control the disease and enable people with asthma to enjoy a normal, active life. There are two main types of inhaler: bronchodilators (such as salbutamol), that open the air passages and relieve symptoms; and steroids (such as beclometasone) that reduce inflammation in the air passages, which improves asthma symptoms and reduces the risk of severe asthma attacks and death. People with asthma may need to use their inhaler every day. Their treatment will depend on the frequency of symptoms and the types of inhalers available. Using an inhaler can be difficult, especially for children and during emergency situations. Using a spacer device makes it easier to use an aerosol inhaler. This helps the medicine to reach the lungs more easily. A spacer is a plastic container with a mouthpiece or mask at one end and a hole for the inhaler in the other. A homemade spacer, made from a 500ml plastic bottle, can be as effective as commercially manufactured spacers. Access to inhalers is a problem in many countries. In 2021, bronchodilators were available in public primary health care facilities in half of low- and low-middle income countries, and steroid inhalers available in one third.

    "text": "Available scientific evidence suggests that there are probably many factors that make a child more likely to have autism, including environmental and genetic factors. Scientific studies show that exposure to certain environmental factors appear to occur more frequently in children with autism, or their parents. These include advanced parental age, maternal diabetes during pregnancy, prenatal exposure to air pollutants or certain heavy metals, prematurity, severe birth complications and low birth weight. In addition, research studies have looked into possible association between use of various medicine during pregnancy and increased risk for autism. For example, prenatal exposure to valproate and carbamazepine, which are used for seizures, appear to occur more frequently in children with autism. More research is needed to better understand the role of each of the factors that appear to be associated with a higher risk for autism, and how they interact with genetic variations. Extensive research using a variety of different methods and conducted over many years has demonstrated that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine does not cause autism (2,3). The study that was interpreted as indicating any such link was later proven to be wrong and fraudulent. The journal that published it withdrew the study, and the doctor who authored it lost his medical license(4,5,6). Evidence also shows that other childhood vaccines do not increase the risk of autism. Extensive research into the preservative thiomersal and the additive aluminium that are contained in some vaccines strongly concluded that these constituents in childhood vaccines do not increase the risk of autism. Assessment and care A broad range of interventions, from early childhood and across the life span, can optimize the development, health, well-being and quality of life of autistic people. Timely access to early evidence-based psychosocial interventions can improve the ability of autistic children to communicate effectively and interact socially. The monitoring of child development as part of routine maternal and child health care is recommended. It is important that, once autism has been diagnosed, children, adolescents and adults with autism and their carers are offered relevant information, services, referrals, and practical support, in accordance with their individual and evolving needs and preferences. The health-care needs of people with autism are complex and require a range of integrated services, that include health promotion, care and rehabilitation. Collaboration between the health sector and other sectors, particularly education, employment and social care, is important.",

Interventions for people with autism and other developmental disabilities need to be designed and delivered with the participation of people living with these conditions. Care needs to be accompanied by actions at community and societal levels for greater accessibility, inclusivity and support. Human rights All people, including people with autism, have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. And yet, autistic people are often subject to stigma and discrimination, including unjust deprivation of health care, education and opportunities to engage and participate in their communities. People with autism have the same health problems as the general population. However, they may, in addition, have specific health-care needs related to autism or other co-occurring conditions. They may be more vulnerable to developing chronic noncommunicable conditions because of behavioural risk factors such as physical inactivity and poor dietary preferences, and are at greater risk of violence, injury and abuse. Autistic people are more likely to die prematurely. People with autism require accessible health services for general health-care needs like the rest of the population, including promotive and preventive services and treatment of acute and chronic illness. Nevertheless, autistic people have higher rates of unmet health-care needs compared with the general population. They are also more vulnerable during humanitarian emergencies. A common barrier is created by health-care providers inadequate knowledge and understanding of autism. WHO resolution on autism spectrum disorders In May 2014, the Sixty-seventh World Health Assembly adopted a resolution entitledComprehensive and coordinated efforts for the management of autism spectrum disorders, which was supported by more than 60 countries.

It also fuels social exclusion and can limit opportunities for education, employment and housing. Bipolar disorder is one of the leading causes of disability globally as it can affect many areas of life. People with bipolar disorder may experience strained relationships, problems at school or work, and difficulties in carrying out daily activities. Having bipolar disorder also increases the risk of suicide and of developing anxiety and substance use disorders. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to smoke, use alcohol, have a physical health condition (e.g. cardiovascular or respiratory disease), and experience difficulties in accessing health care.

During a manic episode, a person experiences an extremely high mood with lots of energy (feeling very happy, excited, overactive). They may have a sense of euphoria, sudden shifts in mood or an excess of emotion (uncontrollable laughing or feeling much more irritable, agitated or restless than usual). In manic episodes, the changes in mood and activities are accompanied by other characteristic symptoms, which may include: highly inflated sense of self-worth or self-esteem; talking quickly and rapidly shifting from one idea to the next; having trouble concentrating and being easily distracted; decreased need for sleep; reckless or risk-taking behaviour, for example overspending, risky sexual activity, drinking, or harming oneself or others; and fixed and mistaken grandiose or persecutory beliefs in something untrue (e.g. I am a very famous person, My neighbour is spying on me). On the contrary, during a depressive episode, a person experiences a depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty). They may feel a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that they had previously enjoyed. Other symptoms are also present, which may include: poor concentration feelings of excessive guilt or low self-worth hopelessness about the future thoughts about dying or suicide disrupted sleep changes in appetite or weight feeling very tired or low in energy. A depressive episode is different from mood fluctuations commonly experienced by most people, in that the symptoms last most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. Both manic and depressive episodes can cause significant difficulties in all aspects of life, including at home, work and school. They may require specialized care to prevent the person from doing harm to themselves or others. Some people with bipolar disorder may experience what are called hypomanic episodes. Hypomanic episodes involve similar symptoms to manic episodes, but the symptoms are less intense and do not typically disrupt the persons ability to function to the same extent. There are two main types of bipolar disorder, depending on patterns of manic or hypomanic and depressive episodes. People withbipolar type I disorderexperience one or more manic episodes interspaced with episodes of depression which usually become more common over time (compared with manic episodes). People withbipolar type II disorderhave had one or more hypomanic episodes and at least one depressive episode, but no history of manic episodes..",

There is substantial variation in the causes of vision impairment between and within countries according to the availability of eye care services, their affordability, and the education of the population. For example, the proportion of vision impairment attributable to unoperated cataract is higher in low- and middle-income countries. In high income countries, diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration are more common. Among children, congenital cataract is a leading cause of vision impairment in low-income countries, whereas in middle-income countries it is more likely to be retinopathy of prematurity. Uncorrected refractive error remains a leading cause of vision impairment in all countries amongst children and adult populations..",

With the goal of ensuring universal access to safe blood and blood products, WHO has been at the forefront to improve blood safety and availability, and recommends the following integrated strategy for blood safety and availability: Establishment of a national blood system with well-organized and coordinated blood transfusion services, effective evidence-based and ethical national blood policies, and legislation and regulation, that can provide sufficient and timely supplies of safe blood and blood products to meet the transfusion needs of all patients. Collection of blood, plasma and other blood components from low-risk, regular, voluntary unpaid donors through the strengthening of donation systems, and effective donor management, including care and counselling. Quality-assured screening of all donated blood for transfusion-transmissible infections, including HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis, confirmatory testing of the results of all donors screen-reactive for infection markers, blood grouping and compatibility testing, and systems for processing blood into blood products (blood components for transfusion and plasma derived-medicinal products), as appropriate, to meet health care needs. Rational use of blood and blood products to reduce unnecessary transfusions and minimize the risks associated with transfusion, the use of alternatives to transfusion where possible, and safe and good clinical transfusion practices, including patient blood management. Step-wise implementation of effective quality systems, including quality management, standards, good manufacturing practices, documentation, training of all staff, and quality assessment. WHO supports countries in developing national blood systems to ensure timely access to safe and sufficient supplies of blood and blood products and good transfusion practices to meet patient needs. WHO provides policy guidance and technical assistance to countries for ensuring universal access to safe blood and blood products and work towards self-sufficiency in safe blood and blood products based on voluntary unpaid blood donation to achieve universal health coverage.

Symptoms usually appear within 12 to 36 hours (within a minimum and maximum range of 4 hours to 8 days) after exposure. Incidence of botulism is low, but the mortality rate is high if prompt diagnosis and appropriate, immediate treatment (early administration of antitoxin and intensive respiratory care) are not given.

WHO, through its cancer research agency, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), maintains a classification of cancer-causing agents. The incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age, most likely due to a build-up of risks for specific cancers that increase with age.

Completion of the treatment protocol in a defined period of time is important to achieve the predicted therapeutic result. Determining the goals of treatment is an important first step. The primary goal is generally to cure cancer or to considerably prolong life. Improving the patients quality of life is also an important goal. This can be achieved by support for the patients physical, psychosocial and spiritual well-being and palliative care in terminal stages of cancer. Some of the most common cancer types, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, oral cancer, and colorectal cancer, have high cure probabilities when detected early and treated according to best practices. Some cancer types, such as testicular seminoma and different types of leukaemia and lymphoma in children, also have high cure rates if appropriate treatment is provided, even when cancerous cells are present in other areas of the body. There is, however, a significant variation in treatment availability between countries of different income levels; comprehensive treatment is reportedly available in more than 90% of high-income countries but less than 15% of low-income countries (3)..",

Treatment is also indicated for patients in whom infection has been reactivated (for example, due to immunosuppression), and during the early chronic phase, including for girls and women of childbearing age (before or after pregnancy) to prevent congenital transmission. Adults with infection, especially those with no symptoms, should be offered treatment because antiparasitic medicines can also prevent or curb disease progression. In other cases, the potential benefits in preventing or delaying the development of Chagas disease should be weighed against the duration of treatment (up to 2 months) and possible adverse reactions (occurring in up to 40% of adults). Benznidazole and nifurtimox should not be administered to pregnant women or people with kidney or liver failure. Nifurtimox is also contraindicated for people with a background of neurological or psychiatric disorders. Additionally, life-lasting follow up and specific treatment for cardiac, digestive or neurological manifestations are usually required..",

The risk ofT. cruzitransmission by transfusion has decreased sharply following the universal screening in all blood banks of continental Latin American countries, and progressively in other countries and continents. WHO recognized Chagas disease as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) in 2005. This facilitated its greater recognition as a global public health problem and was instrumental to strengthen prevention, early diagnosis and antiparasitic treatment, comprehensive care, psychosocial follow up, as well as information, education and communication activities. It also promoted the fight against misinformation, the lack of social demand and the weak political commitment to face the burden of disease. In May 2019, the 72nd World Health Assembly established World Chagas Disease Day, to be celebrated annually on 14 April. The NTD road map 20212030 includes Chagas disease among the conditions targeted for elimination as a public health problem and proposes five targets: To attain the goal of elimination of Chagas disease transmission to humans and provide health care for affected people worldwide, WHO aims to strengthen networking at the global level and reinforcing regional and national capacities.

It is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever, frequently accompanied by severe joint pain. The joint pain is often debilitating and usually lasts for a few days but may be prolonged, lasting for weeks, months or even years. Other common signs and symptoms include joint swelling, muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Since these symptoms overlap with other infections, including those with dengue and Zika viruses, cases can be misdiagnosed. In the absence of significant joint pain, symptoms in infected individuals are usually mild and the infection may go unrecognized. Most patients recover fully from the infection; however, occasional cases of eye, heart, and neurological complications have been reported with CHIKV infections. Patients at extremes of the age spectrum are at higher risk for severe disease including newborns infected during delivery to infected mothers or bitten by infected mosquitoes in the weeks after birth, and older people with underlying medical conditions. Patients with severe disease require hospitalization because of the risk of organ damage and death. Once an individual is recovered, available evidence suggests they are likely to be immune from future chikungunya infections(4)..",

Half of all under-5 deaths in 2020 occurred in just 5 countries: Nigeria, India, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ethiopia. Nigeria and India alone account for almost a third of all deaths. At the country level, under-5 mortality rates in 2020 ranged from 2 deaths per 1000 live births to 115 deaths per 1000 live births, and the risk of dying before turning 5 for a child born in the highest-mortality country was about 65 times higher than in the lowest-mortality country. Globally, infectious diseases, including pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, along with pre-term birth complications, birth asphyxia and trauma and congenital anomalies remain the leading causes of death for children under 5 years. Access to basic lifesaving interventions such as skilled delivery at birth, postnatal care, breastfeeding and adequate nutrition, vaccinations and treatment for common childhood diseases can save many young lives. Malnourished children, particularly those with severe acute malnutrition, have a higher risk of death from common childhood illness such as diarrhoea, pneumonia and malaria.

Some chronic infections, such as HIV, Epstein-Barr virus and malaria, are risk factors for childhood cancer. They are particularly relevant in LMICs. Other infections can increase a childs risk of developing cancer as an adult, so it is important to be vaccinated (against hepatitis B to help prevent liver cancer and against human papillomavirus to help prevent cervical cancer) and to other pursue other methods such as early detection and treatment of chronic infections that can lead to cancer.

The goal is to achieve at least 60% survival for all children with cancer by 2030. This represents an approximate doubling of the current cure rate and will save an additional 1 million lives over the next decade. TheCureAll frameworkand its accompanying technical package have been developed to support implementation of the Initiative. The package helps governments and other stakeholders assess current capacity, set priorities, generate investment cases, develop evidence-based standards of care and monitor progress. An information-sharing portal has been created to facilitate sharing of expertise between countries and partners. The Global Initiative is part of the response to the World Health Assembly resolution Cancer Prevention and Control through an Integrated Approach (WHA70.12), focused on the reduction of premature mortality from NCDs and the achievement of universal health coverage. In December 2021, WHO and St Jude Childrens Research Hospital launched theGlobal Platform for Access to Childhood Cancer Medicines(Global Platform), the first of its kind, to provide an uninterrupted supply of quality-assured childhood cancer medicines with end-to-end support from selecting to dispensing medicines according to best possible care standards. The Global Platform synergizes with the Global Initiative, with activities implemented through this new effort expected to contribute substantially to the achievement of the initiatives goals. WHO and theInternational Agency for Research on Cancer(IARC) collaborate with theInternational Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA) and other UN organizations and partners, to: increase political commitment for childhood cancer control; support governments to develop high-quality cancer centres and regional satellites to ensure early and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment; develop standards and tools to guide the planning and implementation of interventions for early diagnosis, treatment and palliative and survivorship care, improve access to essential medicines and technologies; and support governments to safeguard families of children with cancer from financial harm and social isolation as a result of cancer care.

In pregnant women, it can cause the baby to be born early (prematurity) or with low birth weight. Correct and consistent use of condoms during sex is the most effective way to prevent chlamydia..",

There are several treatments available for COPD. Inhaled medicines that open and reduce swelling in the airways are the main treatments. Bronchodilator inhalers are the most important medicines for treating COPD. They relax the airways to keep them open. Short-acting bronchodilators start to work in seconds and can last for 46 hours. These are often used during flare-ups. Long-acting bronchodilators take longer to start working but last longer. These are taken daily and can be combined with inhaled steroids. Other treatments may also be used: Steroid pills and antibiotics are often used to treat flare-ups. Oxygen is used for people who have had COPD for a long time or have severe COPD. Pulmonary rehabilitation teaches exercises to improve your breathing and ability to exercise. Surgery may improve symptoms for some people with severe COPD. Some inhalers open the airways and may be given regularly to prevent or reduce symptoms, and to relieve symptoms during acute flare-ups. Inhaled corticosteroids are sometimes given in combination with these to reduce inflammation in the lungs. Inhalers must be taken using the correct technique, and in some cases with a spacer device to help deliver the medication into the airways more effectively. Access to inhalers is limited in many low- and middle-income countries; in 2021 salbutamol inhalers were generally available in public primary health care facilities in half of low- and low-middle income countries.

The direct damage costs to health (excluding costs in health-determining sectors such as agriculture and water and sanitation) is estimated to be between US 24 billion per year by 2030. Areas with weak health infrastructure  mostly in developing countries  will be the least able to cope without assistance to prepare and respond. Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases through better transport, food and energy use choices can result in very large gains for health, particularly through reduced air pollution..",

It affects the physical environment as well as all aspects of both natural and human systems  including social and economic conditions and the functioning of health systems. It is therefore a threat multiplier, undermining and potentially reversing decades of health progress. As climatic conditions change, more frequent and intensifying weather and climate events are observed, including storms, extreme heat, floods, droughts and wildfires. These weather and climate hazards affect health both directly and indirectly, increasing the risk of deaths, noncommunicable diseases, the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, and health emergencies. Climate change is also having an impact on our health workforce and infrastructure, reducing capacity to provide universal health coverage (UHC). More fundamentally, climate shocks and growing stresses such as changing temperature and precipitation patterns, drought, floods and rising sea levels degrade the environmental and social determinants of physical and mental health. All aspects of health are affected by climate change, from clean air, water and soil to food systems and livelihoods. Further delay in tackling climate change will increase health risks, undermine decades of improvements in global health, and contravene our collective commitments to ensure the human right to health for all..",

Build better, more climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable health systems:ensuring core services, environmental sustainability and climate resilience as central components of UHC and primary health care (PHC); supporting health systems to leapfrog to cheaper, more reliable and cleaner solutions, while decarbonizing high-emitting health systems; and mainstreaming climate resilience and environmental sustainability into health service investments, including the capacity of the health workforce. Protect health from the wide range of impacts of climate change: assessing health vulnerabilities and developing health plans; integrating climate risk and implementing climate-informed surveillance and response systems for key risks, such as extreme heat and infectious disease; supporting resilience and adaptation in health-determining sectors such as water and food; and closing the financing gap for health adaptation and resilience. Leadership and Raising Awareness: WHO leads in emphasizing climate changes health implications, aiming to centralize health in climate policies, including through the UNFCCC. Partnering with major health agencies, health professionals and civil society, WHO strives to embed climate change in health priorities like UHC and target carbon neutrality by 2030. Evidence and Monitoring: WHO, with its network of global experts, contributes global evidence summaries, provides assistance to nations in their assessments, and monitors progress. The emphasis is on deploying effective policies and enhancing access to knowledge and data. Capacity Building and Country Support: Through WHO offices, support is given to ministries of health, focusing on collaboration across sectors, updated guidance, hands-on training, and support for project preparation and execution as well as for securing climate and health funding. WHO leads theAlliance for Transformative Action on Climate and Health (ATACH), bringing together a range of health and development partners, to support countries in achieving their commitments to climate-resilient and low carbon health systems..",

The risk of colorectal cancer increases with age. Most cases affect people over 50 years old. Common symptoms include diarrhoea, constipation, blood in the stool, abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and low iron levels. Many people will not have symptoms in the early stages of the disease. The risk of colorectal cancer can be reduced by eating a healthy diet, staying physically active, not smoking tobacco and limiting alcohol. Regular screenings are crucial for early detection. Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In 2020, more than 1.9 million new cases of colorectal cancer and more than 930 000 deaths due to colorectal cancer were estimated to have occurred worldwide. Large geographical variations in incidence and mortality rates were observed. The incidence rates were highest in Europe and Australia and New Zealand, and the mortality rates were highest in Eastern Europe. By 2040 the burden of colorectal cancer will increase to 3.2 million new cases per year (an increase of 63%) and 1.6 million deaths per year (an increase of 73%). Incidence rates of colorectal cancer have been decreasing in high-income countries, largely as a result of effective screening programmes. The prognosis for colorectal cancer varies depending on the stage at diagnosis. Early-stage cancers have higher survival rates than advanced-stage cancers. Timely diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and regular follow-up care are important for improving survival rates and quality of life..",

Screening can be conducted during the 3 periods listed: Preconception screening: This can be useful to identify those at risk of specific disorders or of passing a disorder onto their children. Screening includes obtaining family histories and carrier screening and is particularly valuable in countries where consanguineous marriage is common. Peri-conception screening: Maternal characteristics may increase risk, and screening results should be used to offer appropriate care, according to risk. This may include screening for young or advanced maternal age, as well as screening for use of alcohol, tobacco or other risks. Ultrasound can be used to screen for Down syndrome and major structural abnormalities during the first trimester, and for severe fetal anomalies during the second trimester. Maternal blood can be screened for placental markers to aid in prediction of risk of chromosomal abnormalities or neural tube defects, or for free fetal DNA to screen for many chromosomal abnormalities. Diagnostic tests such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis can be used to diagnose chromosomal abnormalities and infections in women at high risk. Neonatal screening: Screening of newborns is an important step towards detection. This helps to reduce mortality and morbidity from congenital disorders by facilitating earlier referral and the initiation of medial or surgical treatment. Early screening for hearing loss provides an opportunity for early correction and allows the possibility of acquiring better language, speech and communication skills. Early screening of newborns for congenital cataract also allows early referral and surgical correction which increases the likelihood of sight. Newborns may be screened for certain metabolic, hematologic and endocrine disorders, many of which may not have immediately visible effects. The conditions screened for vary by country, depending on prevalence and cost. Newborn screening is increasingly conducted even in low- and middle-income countries. Treatment and care Some congenital disorders can be treated with medical or surgical interventions. Access to this care may vary by country and by different levels of a health system, though complex care is increasingly available in low- and middle-income settings. Surgery with good follow up care can often mitigate the potential lethality (as in the case of congenital heart defects) or the morbidity (e.g., congenital talipes, cleft lippalate) associated with structural congenital disorders.",

A clear example is congenital hypothyroidism, where early detection and treatment allows full physical and mental development to healthy adulthood, whereas a missed diagnosis or unavailability of a simple treatment carries a risk of serious intellectual disability.

WHO is also working with partners to provide the required technical expertise for the surveillance of neural tube defects, for monitoring fortification of staple foods with folic acid, and for improving laboratory capacity for assessing risks for folic acid-preventable congenital disorders and is assisting low- and middle-income countries in improving control and elimination of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome through immunization. WHO develops normative tools, including guidelines and a global plan of action, to strengthen medical care and rehabilitation services to support the implementation of theUnited Nations convention on the rights of persons with disabilities..",

    "text": "Corporal or physical punishment of children is highly prevalent, both in homes and schools. Globally, an estimated 1.2 billion children aged 018 years are subjected to corporal punishment at home each year. In some countries, almost all students report being physically punished by school staff. The risk of being physically punished is similar for boys and girls, and for children from wealthy and poor households. Evidence shows corporal punishment harms childrens physical and mental health, increases behavioural problems over time, and has no positive outcomes. All corporal punishment, however mild or light, carries an inbuilt risk of escalation. Studies suggest that parents who used corporal punishment are at heightened risk of perpetrating severe maltreatment. Corporal punishment is linked to a range of negative outcomes for children across countries and cultures, including physical and mental ill-health, impaired cognitive and socio-emotional development, poor educational outcomes, increased aggression and perpetration of violence. Corporal punishment is a violation of childrens rights to respect for physical integrity and human dignity, health, development, education and freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The elimination of violence against children is called for in several targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development but most explicitly in Target 16.2: end abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children. Corporal punishment and the associated harms are preventable through multisectoral and multifaceted approaches, including law reform, changing harmful norms around child rearing and punishment, parent and caregiver support, and school-based programming..",

Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually one to three days, with a maximum of nine days.

Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia, (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After two to four days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement). Other clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin. The petechiae may give way to larger rashes called ecchymoses, and other haemorrhagic phenomena. There is usually evidence of hepatitis, and severely ill patients may experience rapid kidney deterioration, sudden liver failure or pulmonary failure after the fifth day of illness. The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30%, with death occurring in the second week of illness.

In conflict or war, key health infrastructure or CBRN facilities can be deliberately damaged, contaminated or destroyed with widespread consequences. Geopolitical shifts and conflicts create new circumstances for DEs. In addition to these traditional agents, emerging threats include disinformation and the misuse of cyber and technology means, with direct or indirect consequences on human health (fear, mistrust, major psychological impacts, delay in access to care, etc.). Scientific advances and access to technological and digital tools have increased the potential risks of high-consequence DEs. Atomic science is known as a typical example of a so-called double-edged sword; something that has or can have both favourable and unfavourable consequences. For example, nuclear power can be used for sustainable and large-scale energy production or nuclear weapons of mass destruction. This is also true for health and life science research, which is sometimes known as dual-use research of concern (DURC). For example, while understanding key characteristics of microorganisms will help prevention and control of infectious diseases, application of gene editing and reconstruction science can lead to a new and disastrous pathogen. The public health, economic and national security consequences from DEs have made it necessary for governments to seek to prevent such use, to have the means of detecting such events and to prepare for and be ready to respond to them. These efforts should be developed as an integral part of existing national emergency and public health plans. Uncertainty about exposure to a deliberately released agent is likely to increase fear, anxiety and panic amongst the general public. Preparedness, training and education, risk communication and debriefing aimed at mitigating psychological consequences are important to consider for ensuring the mental health of front-line workers and affected populations..",

However WHO may collaborate with and support other entities or mechanisms, such as theUnited Nations Secretary-Generals Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons (UNSGM), which is mandated to carry out prompt investigations in response to allegations of the possible use of chemical and bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons. WHOs response to DE includes: working with international or national organizations and laboratories to characterize the nature, scope, and impact of the DE; offering targeted training to public health and front-line responders; facilitating the identification and acquisition of necessary response materials and providing medical countermeasures in certain circumstances; developing context-specific guidance and training material to the substance in question; and guiding and coordinating national, regional and global responses with specific partners. Depending on the scale and nature of the DE, WHO could also request additional international expert support through the Global Outbreak and Response Network (GOARN), WHO Collaborating Centres, theUN Humanitarian Emergency Cluster system,Standby Partnersand other networks as needed. WHO proposes to strengthen preparedness for DEs as an integral part of existing national emergency and public health plans.WHO promotes an all-hazard approachand the core capacity development of Member States for prevention and response to events of concern and public health emergencies regardless of natural, accidental or deliberate nature. Specifically as preparedness and readiness considering DE, it is essential to ensure awareness among the national stakeholders about potential risks, and to establish communication particularly between the health and the security sectors, known asHealth-Security Interface. Furthermore, WHO works on strengthening inter-agency preparedness for and response to biorisk. Together with the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA), WHO co-leads the UN Biorisk Working Group (UN-BRWG), which brings together 30 member organizations seeking to harmonize and coordinate policy, normative and technical expertise to increase the international communitys capacity to address biorisks effectively..",

Dementia results from a variety of diseases and injuries that affect the brain. Alzheimer disease is the most common form of dementia and may contribute to 6070% of cases. Dementia is currently the seventh leading cause of death and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people globally. In 2019, dementia cost economies globally US 1.3 trillion, approximately 50% of these costs are attributable to care provided by informal carers (e.g. family members and close friends), who provide on average 5 hours of care and supervision per day. Women are disproportionately affected by dementia, both directly and indirectly.

It mainly affects older people but not all people will get it as they age. Things that increase the risk of developing dementia include: age (more common in those 65 or older) high blood pressure (hypertension) high blood sugar (diabetes) being overweight or obese smoking drinking too much alcohol being physically inactive being socially isolated depression. Dementia is a syndrome that can be caused by a number of diseases which over time destroy nerve cells and damage the brain, typically leading to deterioration in cognitive function (i.e. the ability to process thought) beyond what might be expected from the usual consequences of biological ageing. While consciousness is not affected, the impairment in cognitive function is commonly accompanied, and occasionally preceded, by changes in mood, emotional control, behaviour, or motivation. Dementia has physical, psychological, social and economic impacts, not only for people living with dementia, but also for their carers, families and society at large. There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatization and barriers to diagnosis and care..",

Early signs and symptoms are: forgetting things or recent events losing or misplacing things getting lost when walking or driving being confused, even in familiar places losing track of time difficulties solving problems or making decisions problems following conversations or trouble finding words difficulties performing familiar tasks misjudging distances to objects visually. Common changes in mood and behaviour include: feeling anxious, sad, or angry about memory loss personality changes inappropriate behaviour withdrawal from work or social activities being less interested in other peoples emotions. Dementia affects each person in a different way, depending upon the underlying causes, other health conditions and the persons cognitive functioning before becoming ill. Most symptoms become worse over time, while others might disappear or only occur in the later stages of dementia. As the disease progresses, the need for help with personal care increases. People with dementia may not be able to recognize family members or friends, develop difficulties moving around, lose control over their bladder and bowls, have trouble eating and drinking and experience behaviour changes such as aggression that are distressing to the person with dementia as well as those around them..",

In addition, some medications can help manage dementia symptoms: Cholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil are used to treat Alzheimer disease. NMDA receptor antagonists like memantine are used for severe Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia. Medicines to control blood pressure and cholesterol can prevent additional damage to the brain due to vascular dementia. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can help with severe symptoms of depression in people living with dementia if lifestyle and social changes dont work, but these should not be the first option. If people living with dementia are at risk of hurting themselves or others, medicines like haloperidol and risperidone can help, but these should never be used as the first treatment.",

The diagnostic algorithms, testing strategies and test methodologies employed vary, depending on the capabilities of national laboratory systems. The wide range of available tests  including nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)  vary significantly in quality and performance. Laboratory testing for arboviruses can be accomplished through either direct detection methods such as virus isolation, molecular detection of nucleic acid or antigen testing, including rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) within the first week of illness. There is no specific treatment for dengue, although pain can be managed with medication such as paracetamol (acetaminophen). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen and aspirin should be avoided as they can increase the risk of bleeding. Global burden The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically worldwide in recent decades, with the number of cases reported to WHO increasing from 505 430 cases in 2000 to 14.6 million in 2024. The vast majority of cases are asymptomatic or mild and self-managed, and hence the actual numbers of dengue cases are under-reported. The disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries. In 2024, more cases of dengue were recorded than ever before in a 12-month period, affecting over 100 countries on all continents. During 2024, ongoing transmission, combined with an unexpected spike in dengue cases, resulted in a historic high of over 14.6 million cases and more than 12 000 dengue-related deaths reported. The Region of the Americas contributed a significant proportion of the global burden, with over 13 million cases reported to WHO. Several factors are associated with the increasing risk of spread of the dengue epidemic, including the changing distribution of the responsible vectors (chieflyAedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus), especially in previously dengue-naive countries; climate change leading to increasing temperatures, high rainfall and humidity; fragile and overburdened health systems; limitations in surveillance and reporting; and political and financial instabilities in countries facing complex humanitarian crises and high population movements. One modelling estimate indicates 390 million dengue virus infections per year, of which 96 million manifest clinically(1).A recent study on the prevalence of dengue estimates that 5.6 billion people are at risk of infection with dengue and other arboviruses(2). Dengue is spreading to new areas, including the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions.",

One of the most important ways to treat diabetes is to keep a healthy lifestyle. Some people with type 2 diabetes will need to take medicines to help manage their blood sugar levels. These can include insulin injections or other medicines. Some examples include: metformin sulfonylureas sodium-glucose co-transporters type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. Along with medicines to lower blood sugar, people with diabetes often need medications to lower their blood pressure and statins to reduce the risk of complications. Additional medical care may be needed to treat the effects of diabetes: foot care to treat ulcers screening and treatment for kidney disease eye exams to screen for retinopathy (which causes blindness)..",

To this end, WHO: provides scientific guidelines for the prevention of major noncommunicable diseases including diabetes; develops norms and standards for diabetes diagnosis and care; builds awareness on the global epidemic of diabetes, marking World Diabetes Day (14 November); and conducts surveillance of diabetes and its risk factors. In April 2021 WHO launched the Global Diabetes Compact, a global initiative aiming for sustained improvements in diabetes prevention and care, with a particular focus on supporting low- and middle-income countries. In May 2021, the World Health Assembly agreed a Resolution on strengthening prevention and control of diabetes. In May 2022 the World Health Assembly endorsed five global diabetes coverage targets to be achieved by 2030.

    "text": "Diarrhoeal disease is the third leading cause of death in children under 5 years old and is responsible for killing around 443 832 children every year. Diarrhoea can last several days and can leave the body without the water and salts that are necessary for survival. In the past, for most people, severe dehydration and fluid loss were the main causes of diarrhoea-associated deaths. Now, other causes such as septic bacterial infections are likely to account for an increasing proportion of all diarrhoea-associated deaths. Children who are malnourished or have impaired immunity, as well as people living with HIV, are most at risk of life-threatening diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is defined as the passage of 3 or more loose or liquid stools per day (or more frequent passage than is normal for the individual). Frequent passing of formed stools is not diarrhoea, nor is the passing of loose, pasty stools by breastfed babies. Diarrhoea is usually a symptom of an infection in the intestinal tract, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water, or from person-to-person as a result of poor hygiene. Interventions to prevent diarrhoea, including safe drinking-water, use of improved sanitation and hand washing with soap, can reduce disease risk. Diarrhoea should be treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS), a solution of clean water, sugar and salt. In addition, a 1014 day supplemental treatment course of dispersible zinc tablets shortens diarrhoea duration and improves outcomes. There are 3 clinical types of diarrhoea: acute watery diarrhoea  lasts several hours or days and includes cholera acute bloody diarrhoea  also called dysentery persistent diarrhoea  lasts 14 days or longer..",

Infection is more common when there is a shortage of adequate sanitation and hygiene and safe water for drinking, cooking and cleaning. Among children under 5 years of age, the most common viral pathogens are rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus and astrovirus. Bacterial pathogens includeEscherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Campylobacter spp., while parasitic pathogens includeCryptosporidium,Giardia, andEntamoeba spp. Rotavirus andE. coliare the most common pathogens among children across all age groups, while parasitic pathogens, are prevalent in children aged 35 years. Bacterial pathogens, includingE. coli,Salmonella, andShigella, were common in the children age 6 to 10-year age group, as were rotavirus, norovirus, and sapovirus. Location-specific etiologic patterns also need to be considered. Malnutrition:Children who die from diarrhoea often suffer from underlying malnutrition, which makes them more vulnerable to diarrhoea. Each diarrhoeal episode, in turn, makes their malnutrition even worse. Diarrhoea is a leading cause of malnutrition in children under 5 years old. Source:Water contaminated with human faeces, for example from sewage, septic tanks and latrines, is of particular concern. Animal faeces also contain microorganisms that can cause diarrhoea. Other causes:Diarrhoeal disease can also spread from person-to-person, aggravated by poor personal hygiene. Food is another major cause of diarrhoea when it is prepared or stored in unhygienic conditions. Unsafe domestic water storage and handling is also an important risk factor. Fish and seafood from polluted water may also contribute to the disease..",

The choice must primarily be based on the ultrasound images of the cyst, following a stage-specific approach, and also on the medical infrastructure and human resources available. For alveolar echinococcosis, early diagnosis and radical (tumour-like) surgery followed by anti-infective prophylaxis with albendazole remain the key elements. If the lesion is confined, radical surgery can be curative. Unfortunately in many patients the disease is diagnosed at an advanced stage.

It is characterized by recurrent seizures, which are brief episodes of involuntary movement that may involve a part of the body (partial) or the entire body (generalized) and are sometimes accompanied by loss of consciousness and control of bowel or bladder function. Seizure episodes are a result of excessive electrical discharges in a group of brain cells. Different parts of the brain can be the site of such discharges. Seizures can vary from the briefest lapses of attention or muscle jerks to severe and prolonged convulsions. Seizures can also vary in frequency, from less than one per year to several per day. One seizure does not signify epilepsy (up to 10% of people worldwide have one seizure during their lifetime). Epilepsy is defined as having two or more unprovoked seizures. Epilepsy is one of the worlds oldest recognized conditions, with written records dating back to 4000 BCE. Fear, misunderstanding, discrimination and social stigma have surrounded epilepsy for centuries. This stigma continues in many countries today and can impact on the quality of life for people with the disease and their families..",

A documented etiology of the seizure and an abnormal electroencephalography (EEG) pattern are the two most consistent predictors of seizure recurrence. In low-income countries, about three quarters of people with epilepsy may not receive the treatment they need. This is called the treatment gap. In many low- and middle-income countries, there is low availability of antiseizure medicines. A recent study found the average availability of generic antiseizure medicines in the public sector of low- and middle-income countries to be less than 50%. This may act as a barrier to accessing treatment. It is possible to diagnose and treat most people with epilepsy at the primary health-care level without the use of sophisticated equipment. WHO pilot projects have indicated that training primary health-care providers to diagnose and treat epilepsy can effectively reduce the epilepsy treatment gap.

Recently, WHO published an epilepsy technical brief, which outlines actions for policy makers and healthcare planners to reduce the burden of epilepsy in countries through finding and prioritizing the most effective solutions in a wide range of societal sectors. WHO, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and the International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE) led the Global Campaign Against Epilepsy to bring the disease out of the shadows to provide better information and raise awareness about epilepsy and to strengthen public and private efforts to improve care and reduce the diseases impact. These efforts have contributed to the prioritization of epilepsy in many countries and projects have been carried out to reduce the treatment gap and morbidity of people with epilepsy, to train and educate health professionals, to dispel stigma, to identify potential prevention strategies, and to develop models integrating epilepsy care into local health systems. Combining several innovative strategies, these projects have shown that there are simple, cost-effective ways to treat epilepsy in low-resource settings. The WHO Programme on reducing the epilepsy treatment gap and the mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) achieved these goals in Ghana, Mozambique, Myanmar and Viet Nam, where 6.5 million more people have access to treatment for epilepsy should they need it..",

The practice has no health benefits for girls and women and can result in severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, menstrual difficulties, infections, as well as complications in childbirth and increased risk of newborn deaths. The practice of FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against girls and women. It is nearly always carried out on minors and is a violation of the rights of children. The practice also violates a persons right to health, security and physical integrity; the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; and the right to life, in instances when the procedure results in death. In several settings, there is evidence suggesting greater involvement of health workers in performing FGM due to the belief that the procedure is safer when medicalized. WHO strongly urges health workers not to perform FGM and has developed a global strategy and specific materials to support the health sector and health workers themselves to end FGM medicalization..",

Chronic infections are associated with severe morbidity with symptoms reflecting the organ in which the adult worms are located in. Acute infection withOpisthorchis sppandClonorchis sinensismay be asymptomatic in light infections but clinical symptoms such as fever, right upper-quadrant pain may be seen with high parasite burdens due to obstruction of the gallbladder by the worm. Chronic infection fromO. viverriniandC. sinensisresulting from protracted episodes of re-infection over time may be most severe, with chronic inflammation resulting in fibrosis the ducts and destruction of the adjacent liver parenchyma. These changes can result in cholangiocarcinoma, a severe bile duct cancer which is often fatal. For this reason, bothO. viverriniandC. sinensisare classified as carcinogens. Data on chronic infections withO. felineusis sparse, and this parasite is not classified as a carcinogen. Fascioliasis consists of an asymptomatic incubation period following ingestion of the parasite which is then followed by an acute and a chronic clinical phase. The acute phase ofFasciolainfection begins when the immature worms penetrate the intestinal wall and peritoneum then puncture the liver surface and travel to the bile ducts. This process results in destruction of liver cells and causes internal bleeding. Symptoms can include fever, nausea, swollen liver, skin rashes and severe abdominal pain. The chronic phase begins when the worms reach the bile ducts, mature and start producing eggs. These eggs are released into the bile then reach the intestine before being evacuated in faeces. Symptoms can include intermittent pain, jaundice, anaemia, pancreatitis and gallstones. Chronic infections result in liver cirrhosis due to long-term inflammation. Early stages of paragonimiasis may be asymptomatic. Once worms reach the lungs symptoms can be significant and include a chronic cough with blood stained sputum, chest pain, dyspnoea, and fever, and can result in complications of pleural effusion and pneumothorax. Symptoms and signs can be confounded with tuberculosis and should be considered in suspected tuberculosis patients that are not responding to treatment. Ectopic paragonimiasis is also common with cerebral paragonimiasis being most common. Symptoms associated with this include headaches, visual impairment, epileptic seizures and cerebral haemorrhage..",

An integrated One Health approach which links animal, human and environmental aspects should be used. Interventions such as information, education and communication on safe food practices, improved sanitation and veterinary public health measures should be implemented to decrease transmission rates and reduce risk of infection. To control morbidity, WHO recommends improved access to treatment using safe and effective anthelmintic medicines Treatment of clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis relies on praziquantel, administered at a dose of 25mgkg 3 times daily for 2-3 consecutive days or of a single administration at 40mgkg. Fascioliasis should be treated with triclabendazole 10mgkg administered as a single dose. Where treatment failure occurs, the dosage may be increased to 20mgkg in two divided doses 12-24 hours apart. Paragonimiasis can be treated with triclabendazole 20mgkg, in two divided doses of 10mgkg to be administered on the same day, or praziquantel 25mgkg 3 times a day for 3 days. Treatment with triclabendazole is preferred due to the simplicity of its regiment and thus its higher compliances to treatment. For the purposes of public health control, WHO recommends carrying out community diagnosis at the district level and implementing population-based preventive chemotherapy in areas where large number of people are infected. Individual case-management with treatment of people with confirmed or suspected infection is appropriate where cases are less clustered and where health facilities are available. Preventive chemotherapy alone is insufficient to reduce prevalence. Factors such as poor sanitation and food hygiene, animal reservoirs and cultural eating habits contribute to high reinfection rates after treatment. As such, mass drug administration programmes should be part of a wider One Health approach incorporating community health education, veterinary and agricultural interventions, food safety and improved water, sanitation and hygiene.

Fractures are more likely to occur in older people, especially older women. Most fractures in older people are due to bone fragility (fragility fractures) and result from mechanical forces quantified as equivalent to a fall from standing height or less (known as low energy trauma).

Due to worldwide population growth and ageing, the number of people sustaining a fracture each year has been increasing. Currently, there are no global estimates on fragility fractures, and available data include all fractures combined. According to data from the Global Burden of Disease Study, the absolute incidence, prevalence and years lived with disability for fractures have significantly increased from 1990 to 2019, with highest age-specific incidence rates in the oldest age groups(1)in which most fractures are due to bone fragility (fragility fractures). These substantial increases have been associated with increased healthcare costs globally. In the largest five countries of the European Union plus Sweden, the annual costs of fragility fractures are expected to increase by 27% by 2030(2). The same trend is reported in other parts of the world. Therefore, preventing fragility fractures through early assessment of risk factors and treatment of osteoporosis is essential for good health and well-being for all adults, and particularly so for older people..",

FHC policies also aim to enhance the quality of the health services guaranteed through this policy. Transparency and accountability are important aspects, as eligible people need to know if the policy applies to them. While FHC policies may trigger an increase in the use of services, evidence on improved financial protection is mixed. People may still have to make direct payments for other services they need. Moreover, if not properly anticipated and backed by increased supplies and medicines, FHC may have negative unintended consequences, such as patients having to pay for this scarce supply informally or in the private sector. Also, if user fees previously retained at the facility level are abolished, their effect as a direct incentive for health workers disappears, possibly leading to demotivated staff. Overall, the impacts of FHC policies have so far been mixed, especially for poor people, who may not benefit at all, or benefit to a lesser extent compared with better-off people. There are differences across and within countries, but overall, public funding tends to benefit better-off populations. Various aspects on the supply and demand sides may cause this trend in public funding. On the supply side, availability of health services is better in wealthier areas. On the demand-side, barriers can be financial and non-financial, such as limited geographical access to facilities or cultural and language barriers. Finally, setting up separate funding and remuneration mechanisms for FHC policies (when not linked with other health financing mechanisms) may contribute to fragmenting the health financing system. When there are several FHC policies in place for a variety of services, they may create disincentives to enrol in health insurance schemes with more comprehensive benefit packages..",

Diagnosing and addressing the factors that prevent the poor from using priority health services are all critical to ensuring FHC policies benefit the most vulnerable. Health services must be made available to the most distant and vulnerable population groups. A related measure is to increase the autonomy of health service providers. Policy makers need to look for synergies and ensure that FHC policies lead towards a coherent health financing architecture.

The ICD-11 describes three diagnostic requirements: 1) impaired control over gambling; 2) increasing priority given to gambling, taking precedence over other life interests and daily activities; and 3) continuation of gambling despite negative consequences. Gambling harm also occurs well below clinical thresholds. Signs of harm include the diversion of money from essential household spending. This can lead to food insecurity, housing problems and difficulties accessing healthcare and education..",

Self-help, pharmacological interventions and mutual support have less evidence of efficacy, although the latter are among the most used interventions. Some evidence supports internet-based therapies, although attrition is a significant issue. Treatment for gambling disorder has a low rate of uptake, with an estimated 0.14% of the population seeking formal and informal help for current problems. Stigma and shame often prevent people from seeking help. The preferred regulatory approach of the gambling industry  so-called responsible gambling  adds to this burden by effectively blaming those who experience harm. Responsible gambling interventions are typically ineffective, particularly where the uptake of measures is optional. Those seeking to better control or cease gambling should be provided with tools to support them. These include universal pre-commitment (requiring people to set binding limits of time and money spent gambling) and self-exclusion (allowing people to ban themselves from gambling providers). Universal (also known as mandatory) systems are most effective. Voluntary systems have poor uptake and are non-enforceable. Prevention is the most cost-effective strategy for minimizing gambling-related harm..",

WHO is coordinating a group of global experts to build capacity to address public health implications of gambling. Initial efforts include leading the development of new diagnostic instruments for gambling disorder to better reflect populations outside North America and facilitating an expert consensus on diagnostic boundaries. WHO recognizes that some jurisdictions have developed effective gambling regulatory systems. Efforts to document and distribute these lessons are underway, particularly to support low- and middle-income countries where commercial gambling activity is rapidly increasing. References.",

The disposal of untreated health care wastes in landfills can lead to the contamination of drinking, surface, and ground waters if those landfills are not properly constructed. Minimization of health care waste should be a priority. This will significantly reduce the amount of waste that needs to be handled and treated. Waste minimization actions include green procurement and selecting products where shipping is minimized and with less and ecological packaging, switching to re-usables when safe and viable, only orderingreceiving pharmaceuticals based on documented need, and recycling common items including plastic, paper and cardboard. The treatment of health care wastes with chemical disinfectants can result in the release of chemical substances into the environment if those substances are not handled, stored and disposed in an environmentally sound manner. Incineration of waste is widely practised, but inadequate incineration or the incineration of unsuitable materials results in the release of pollutants into the air and in the generation of ash residue. Incinerated materials containing or treated with chlorine can generate dioxins and furans, which are human carcinogens and have been associated with a range of adverse health effects. Incineration of heavy metals or materials with high metal content (in particular lead, mercury and cadmium) can lead to the spread of toxic metals in the environment. Only modern incinerators operating at 8501100 C and fitted with special gas-cleaning equipment are able to comply with the international emission standards for dioxins and furans. Alternatives to incineration such as autoclaving, microwaving, steam treatment integrated with internal mixing, which minimize the formation and release of chemicals or hazardous emissions should be given consideration in settings where there are sufficient resources to operate and maintain such systems and dispose of the treated waste..",

    "text": "A healthy diet helps to protect against malnutrition in all its forms, as well as noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer. Unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity are leading global risks to health. Healthy dietary practices start early in life  breastfeeding fosters healthy growth and improves cognitive development, and may have longer term health benefits such as reducing the risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing NCDs later in life. Energy intake (calories) should be in balance with energy expenditure. To avoid unhealthy weight gain, total fat should not exceed 30% of total energy intake (1, 2, 3). Intake of saturated fats should be less than 10% of total energy intake, and intake of trans-fats less than 1% of total energy intake, with a shift in fat consumption away from saturated fats and trans-fats to unsaturated fats (3), and towards the goal of eliminating industrially-produced trans-fats (4, 5, 6). Limiting intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake (2, 7) is part of a healthy diet. A further reduction to less than 5% of total energy intake is suggested for additional health benefits (7). Keeping salt intake to less than 5 g per day (equivalent to sodium intake of less than 2 g per day) helps to prevent hypertension, and reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke in the adult population (8). WHO Member States have agreed to reduce the global populations intake of salt by 30% by 2025; they have also agreed to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity in adults and adolescents as well as in childhood overweight by 2025 (9, 10)..",

    "text": "The WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health(14)was adopted in 2004 by the Health Assembly. The strategy called on governments, WHO, international partners, the private sector and civil society to take action at global, regional and local levels to support healthy diets and physical activity. In 2010, the Health Assembly endorsed a set of recommendations on the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children(15). These recommendations guide countries in designing new policies and improving existing ones to reduce the impact on children of the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children. WHO has also developed region-specific tools (such as regional nutrient profile models) that countries can use to implement the marketing recommendations. In 2012, the Health Assembly adopted a Comprehensive Implementation Plan on Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition and six global nutrition targets to be achieved by 2025, including the reduction of stunting, wasting and overweight in children, the improvement of breastfeeding, and the reduction of anaemia and low birthweight(9). In 2013, the Health Assembly agreed to nine global voluntary targets for the prevention and control of NCDs. These targets include a halt to the rise in diabetes and obesity, and a 30% relative reduction in the intake of salt by 2025. The Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 20132020(10)provides guidance and policy options for Member States, WHO and other United Nations agencies to achieve the targets. With many countries now seeing a rapid rise in obesity among infants and children, in May 2014 WHO set up the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity. In 2016, the Commission proposed a set of recommendations to successfully tackle childhood and adolescent obesity in different contexts around the world(16). In November 2014, WHO organized, jointly with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2). ICN2 adopted the Rome Declaration on Nutrition(17),and the Framework for Action(18)which recommends a set of policy options and strategies to promote diversified, safe and healthy diets at all stages of life. WHO is helping countries to implement the commitments made at ICN2. In May 2018, the Health Assembly approved the 13th General Programme of Work (GPW13), which will guide the work of WHO in 20192023(19).",

Heat stress is the leading cause of weather-related deaths and can exacerbate underlying illnesses including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health, asthma, and can increase the risk of accidents and transmission of some infectious diseases. Heatstroke is a medical emergency with a high-case fatality rate. The number of people exposed to extreme heat is growing exponentially due to climate change in all world regions. Heat-related mortality for people over 65 years of age increased by approximately 85% between 20002004 and 20172021(1). Between 20002019 studies show approximately 489 000 heat-related deaths occur each year, with 45% of these in Asia and 36% in Europe(2). In Europe alone in the summer of 2022, an estimated 61 672 heat-related excess deaths occurred(3). High intensity heatwave events can bring high acute mortality; in 2003, 70 000 people in Europe died as a result of the JuneAugust event. In 2010, 56 000 excess deaths occurred during a 44day heatwave in the Russian Federation. Vulnerability to heat is shaped by both physiological factors, such as age and health status, and exposure factors such as occupation and socio-economic conditions. The negative health impacts of heat are predictable and largely preventable with specific public health and multi-sectoral policies and interventions.

    "text": "A heatwave is a period where local excess heat accumulates over a sequence of unusually hot days and nights. Heatwaves and prolonged excess heat conditions are increasing in frequency, duration, intensity and magnitude due to climate change. Even low and moderate intensity heat waves can impact the health and well-being of vulnerable populations. The frequency and intensity of extreme heat and heat waves will continue to rise in the 21st century because of climate change. Extended periods of high day and nighttime temperature conditions create cumulative stress on the human body, increasing the risk of illness and death from heat exposure. Heatwaves can acutely impact large populations for short periods of time, often trigger public health emergencies, and result in excess mortality and cascading socioeconomic impacts (for example, lost work capacity and labour productivity). They can also cause loss of health service delivery capacity, when power shortages accompany heatwaves and disrupt health facilities, transport and water infrastructure. Population ageing and the growing prevalence of non-communicable diseases (respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, dementia, renal disease and musculoskeletal disease) means that populations are becoming more susceptible to negative heat impacts. Cities are not being designed to minimize the accumulation and generation of urban heat, with a loss of greenspace and inappropriate housing materials (for example, metal roofs) that amplify human exposure to excess heat. Awareness among health workers and the public remains insufficient of the health risks posed by heat. Health professionals should adjust their guidance, planning and interventions to account for increasing heat exposures, as well as to manage acute increases in admissions associated with heatwaves. Practical, feasible and often low-cost interventions at the individual, community, organizational, governmental and societal levels can save lives..",

    "text": "The amount of heat stored in the human body is determined by a combination of (a) an inability to eliminate internally generated heat from metabolic processes due to environmental heat stress (for example, high temperature, high humidity, low wind, high thermal radiation), (b) clothing creating a barrier to heat loss, (c) external heat gain from the environment. The bodys inability to regulate internal temperature and eliminate heat gain in such conditions increases the risk of heat exhaustion and heatstroke. The strain put on the body as it tries to cool itself also stresses the heart and kidneys. As a result, heat extremes can worsen health risks from chronic conditions (cardiovascular, mental, respiratory and diabetes related conditions) and cause acute kidney injury. Deaths and hospitalizations triggered by extreme hot weather occur rapidly (same day and following days), which means interventions also need to be rapid when a heat alert is issued. Heat can also disrupt and compromise essential health services, such as the loss of power supply and transport. Heat will reduce working productivity and increases the risk of accidents. It is difficult to complete work or learning in very hot weather and heatwaves may lead schools and other institutions to close. Heatwaves can also be associated with hazardous air pollution events. The scale and nature of the health impacts of heat depend on the timing, intensity and duration of a heat event, and the level of acclimatization and adaptability of the local population, infrastructure and institutions to the prevailing climate.

Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A does not cause chronic liver disease but it can cause mild to severe symptoms and rarely fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure), which is often fatal. WHO estimates that in 2016, 7134 persons died from hepatitis A worldwide (accounting for 0.5% of the mortality due to viral hepatitis). Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in epidemics worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences. Epidemics related to contaminated food or water can erupt explosively, such as the epidemic in Shanghai in 1988 that affected about 300 000 people(1). They can also be prolonged, affecting communities for months through person-to-person transmission.

The virus can cause both acute and chronic hepatitis, ranging in severity from a mild illness to a serious, lifelong illness including liver cirrhosis and cancer. The hepatitis C virus is a bloodborne virus and most infection occurs through exposure to blood from unsafe injections and procedures in health care, unscreened blood transfusions, sharing of needles and syringes among people who inject drugs and sexual practices that lead to exposure to blood. Globally, an estimated 50 million people have chronic hepatitis C virus infection, with about 1.0 million new infections occurring per year. WHO estimated that in 2022, approximately 242 000 people died from hepatitis C, mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer). Direct-acting antiviral medicines (DAAs) can cure more than 95% of persons with hepatitis C infection, but access to diagnosis and treatment is low. There is currently no effective vaccine against hepatitis C..",

Hepatitis C is spread through contact with infected blood. This can happen through unsafe inections and procedures in health care, unscreened blood transfusions, sharing of needles and syringes among people who inject drugs and sexual practices that lead to exposure to blood. Symptoms can include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine and yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice). There is no vaccine for hepatitis C, but it can be treated and cured with antiviral medications. Early detection and treatment can prevent serious liver damage and improve long-term health. Acute HCV infections are usually asymptomatic and most do not lead to a life-threatening disease. Around 30% (1545%) of infected persons spontaneously clear the virus within 6 months of infection without any treatment. The remaining 70% (5585%) of persons will develop chronic HCV infection. Of those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis ranges from 15% to 30% within 20 years..",

In areas with high disease endemicity, symptomatic infection is most common in young adults aged 1540 years. In these areas, although infection does occur in children, it often goes undiagnosed because they typically have no symptoms or only a mild illness without jaundice. Typical signs and symptoms of hepatitis include: an initial phase of mild fever, reduced appetite (anorexia), nausea and vomiting lasting for a few days; abdominal pain, itching, skin rash or joint pain; jaundice (yellow colour of the skin), dark urine and pale stools; and a slightly enlarged, tender liver (hepatomegaly). These symptoms may be indistinguishable from those experienced during other forms of hepatitis or other infectious diseases in endemic areas, such as leptospirosis, dengue, yellow fever and malaria. The symptoms typically last 16 weeks. Although hepatitis E is commonly considered as an acute, self-limited disease, in rare cases acute hepatitis E can be severe and result in fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure). These patients are at risk of death. Pregnant women with hepatitis E, particularly those in the second or third trimester, are at increased risk of acute liver failure, fetal loss and mortality. Up to 2025% of pregnant women can die if they get hepatitis E in third trimester.

For people whose oral herpes is activated by sunlight, avoiding sun exposure and wearing sunscreen can lower the risk of recurrences. To decrease symptoms of oral herpes, people can: drink cold drinks or suck on popsicles use over-the-counter pain medicines. For genital herpes, people can: sit in a warm bath for 20 minutes (without soap) wear loose fitting clothes use over-the-counter pain medicines. There are ways to lower the risk of spreading herpes including: talk to your partner about having herpes dont have sex if you have symptoms and always wear a condom dont share items that touched saliva (oral herpes).

Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not cure HIV infection but allows a persons immune system to get stronger. This helps them to fight other infections. Currently, ART must be taken every day for the rest of a persons life. ART lowers the amount of the virus in a persons body. This stops symptoms and allows people to live full and healthy lives. People living with HIV who are taking ART and who have no evidence of virus in the blood will not spread the virus to their sexual partners. Pregnant women with HIV should have access to, and take, ART as soon as possible. This protects the health of the mother and will help prevent HIV transmission to the fetus before birth, or through breast milk. Advanced HIV disease remains a persistent problem in the HIV response. WHO is supporting countries to implement the advanced HIV disease package of care to reduce illness and death. Newer HIV medicines and short course treatments for opportunistic infections like cryptococcal meningitis are being developed that may change the way people take ART and prevention medicines, including access to long-acting injectable formulations, such as lenacapavir which now has been approved by the FDA for HIV prevention.

Despite the emergence of resistance, DTG is a highly effective drug in HIV treatment, with more than 90% of patients achieving sustained viral suppression if adherent to treatment. DTG resistance amplifies the urgent need to implement standardized surveys to characterize the prevalence and patterns of DTG resistance mutations and their associated clinical determinants. As the use of dolutegravir-based antiretroviral treatment (ART) is scaled up, remaining vigilant in preventing and monitoring HIV drug resistance among infants newly diagnosed with HIV is imperative. The prevalence of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-associated resistance (defined as resistance to tenofovir andor lamivudine) is low for individuals who acquire HIV while receiving tenofovir-containing PrEP. However, the prevalence of tenofovir and or lamivudine resistance is more than 10-fold higher if PrEP is initiated during undiagnosed acute HIV infection. To stop HIV drug resistance: make optimal antiretroviral medicines available; retain patients in care and ensure adherence to treatment; increase access and use of viral load testing; and switch regimens rapidly in cases of confirmed treatment failure..",

At the end of December 2022, 29.8 million people were accessing ART, up from 7.7 million in 2010. Increased use of HIV medicines has been accompanied by the emergence of HIV drug resistance, the levels of which have steadily increased in recent years. HIV drug resistance is caused by changes in the genetic structure of HIV that affect the ability of medicines to block the replication of the virus. All antiretroviral drugs, including those from newer drug classes, are at risk of becoming partially or fully inactive due to the emergence of drug-resistant virus. If not prevented, HIV drug resistance can jeopardize the efficacy of medicines used to treat HIV(1), resulting in increased numbers of HIV infections and HIV-associated morbidity and mortality(2)..",

This type of resistance can either be transmitted at the time of infection or acquired during previous treatments. WHO recommendssurveillance of HIV drug resistance in adults initiating or reinitiating ARTand intreatment naive infants initiating ARTto inform optimal selection of first-line regimens. Eleven countries reported data to WHO on the prevalence of pretreatment HIV drug resistance to DTG among adults initiating ART. Only one country detected DTG at a very low prevalence of 0.2%, which was attributed to a rare non-polymorphic integrase mutation. However, these surveys were conducted before DTG was introduced or during the early stages of transition in these countries and thus cannot provide evidence of an absence of DTG resistance in populations initiating or reinitiating ART as scale-up and maintenance on DTG-based ART continues. The levels of pretreatment rilpivirine (RPV) resistance among individuals initiating ART without previous exposure to ARV drugs ranged from 0.0% (95% CI 0.09.4%) in Tajikistan in 2016 to a high of 16.6% (95% CI 11.224.0%) in Eswatini. These data suggest that if RPV were to be used in combination with cabotegravir as a long-acting ART, pretreatment HIV drug resistance testing would be needed in some settings to identify those without RPV drug resistance because pretreatment RPV drug resistance mutations are a risk factor for failure to suppress viral load among people treated with long-acting cabotegravir in combination with RPV. To date, only one country has reported data from a survey of HIV drug resistance among infants after introducing DTG-containing regimens. One infant with DTG resistance was identified whose mother had been receiving DTG-based ART. The surveillance of HIV drug resistance among treatment-naive infants newly diagnosed with HIV remains highly relevant in the era of DTG-based ART, and accelerated implementation of these surveys is needed. Moreover, effective management of high viral loads among pregnant and breastfeeding women is critical to prevent transmitting HIV to infants..",

Women and children disproportionately bear the greatest health burden from polluting fuels and technologies in homes as they typically labour over household chores such as cooking and collecting firewood and spend more time exposed to harmful smoke from polluting stoves and fuels. Gathering fuel increases the risk of musculoskeletal injuries and consumes considerable time for women and children  limiting education and other productive activities. In less secure environments, women and children are at risk of injury and violence while gathering fuel. Many of the fuels and technologies used by households for cooking, heating and lighting present safety risks. The ingestion of kerosene by accident is the leading cause of childhood poisonings, and a large fraction of the severe burns and injuries occurring in low- and middle-income countries are linked to household energy use for cooking, heating and lighting(2). The lack of access to electricity for over 750 million(1)people forces households to rely on polluting devices and fuels, such as kerosene lamps for lighting, thus making them exposed to very high levels of fine particulate matter. The time spent using and preparing fuel for inefficient, polluting devices constrains other opportunities for health and development, like studying, leisure time, or productive activities. Black carbon (sooty particles) and methane emitted by inefficient stove combustion are powerful short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs).

HPV can affect the skin, genital area and throat. Condoms help prevent HPV but do not offer total protection because they do not cover all the genital skin. HPV usually goes away on its own without treatment. Some HPV infections cause genital warts. Others can cause abnormal cells to develop, which go on to become cancer. Cancers from HPV can be prevented with vaccines. The vaccine does not contain any live virus or DNA from the virus so it cannot cause cancer or other HPV-related illnesses. The HPV vaccine is not used to treat HPV infections or diseases caused by HPV, but instead to prevent the development of cancers. Currently, cervical cancer is the only HPV-caused cancer for which screening tests are available. Screening tests are used to check for disease when there are no symptoms. The goal of screening for cervical cancer is to find precancerous cell changes before they become cancer and when treatment can prevent cancer from developing. Screening for cervical cancer is an important part of routine health care for people who have a cervix. This includes women and transgender men who still have a cervix.

Early clinical manifestations may be uveitis, dermatitis and pneumonitis. HTLV-1 can cause a form of blood cancer called adult T-cell leukemia or lymphoma. People may present with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, hypercalcaemia through involvement of the skin, lung, bones and other organs. HTLV-1 can also cause a progressive disease of the nervous system called either HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (HAM) or tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP). This is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, characterized by progressive spastic weakness of the lower limbs, lower back pain and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Clinical findings can include muscle weakness, hyperreflexia and clonus in the lower limbs, along with extensor plantar response and a spastic gait. The lifetime risk among people with HTLV-1 infection of developing ATL is estimated at 5% and of HAM or TSP at 2%..",

The document also includes target blood pressure to be achieved for control, and information on who, in the health-care system, can initiate treatment. To support governments in strengthening the prevention and control of cardiovascular disease, WHO and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) launched theGlobal Hearts Initiativein September 2016, which includes the HEARTS technical package. The six modules of theHEARTS technical package(Healthy-lifestyle counselling, Evidence-based treatment protocols, Access to essential medicines and technology, Risk-based management, Team-based care, and Systems for monitoring) provide a strategic approach to improve cardiovascular health in countries across the world. In September 2017, WHO began a partnership with Resolve to Save Lives, an initiative of Vital Strategies, to support national governments to implement the Global Hearts Initiative. Other partners contributing to the Global Hearts Initiative are the CDC Foundation, the Global Health Advocacy Incubator, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the U.S. CDC. Since implementation of the programme in 2017, in more than 40 low- and middle-income countries, 13.5 million people have been put on protocol-based hypertension treatment through person-centred models of care.

Activities that will help to achieve this include those outlined in theGlobal strategy for infant and young child feeding, which aims to protect, promote and support appropriate infant and young child feeding. UNICEF and WHO created the Global Breastfeeding Collective to rally political, legal, financial, and public support for breastfeeding. The Collective brings together implementers and donors from governments, philanthropies, international organizations, and civil society. The Collectives vision is a world in which all mothers have the technical, financial, emotional, and public support they need to breastfeed. WHO has formed the Network for Global Monitoring and Support for Implementation of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and Subsequent Relevant World Health Assembly Resolutions, also known as NetCode. The goal of NetCode is to protect and promote breastfeeding by ensuring that breastmilk substitutes are not marketed inappropriately. Specifically, NetCode is building the capacity of Member States and civil society to strengthen national Code legislation, continuously monitor adherence to the Code, and take action to stop all violations. In addition, WHO and UNICEF have developed courses for training health workers to provide skilled support to breastfeeding mothers, help them overcome problems, and monitor the growth of children, so they can identify early the risk of undernutrition or overweightobesity. WHO provides simple, coherent and feasible guidance to countries for promoting and supporting improved infant feeding by HIV-infected mothers to prevent mother-to-child transmission, good nutrition of the baby, and protect the health of the mother.

In the female reproductive system, infertility may be caused by: tubal disorders such as blocked fallopian tubes, which are in turn caused by untreated sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or complications of unsafe abortion, postpartum sepsis or abdominalpelvic surgery; uterine disorders which could be inflammatory in nature (such as such endometriosis), congenital in nature (such as septate uterus), or benign in nature (such as fibroids); disorders of the ovaries, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome and other follicular disorders; disorders of the endocrine system causing imbalances of reproductive hormones. The endocrine system includes hypothalamus and the pituitary glands. Examples of common disorders affecting this system include pituitary cancers and hypopituitarism. Therelative importance of these causesof female infertility may differ from country to country, for example due to differences in the background prevalence of STIs, or differing ages of populations studied. In the male reproductive system, infertility may be caused by: obstruction of the reproductive tract causing dysfunctionalities in the ejection of semen. This blockage can occur in the tubes that carry semen (such as ejaculatory ducts and seminal vesicles). Blockages are commonly due to injuries or infections of the genital tract; hormonal disorders leading to abnormalities in hormones produced by the pituitary gland, hypothalamus and testicles  hormones such as testosterone regulate sperm production. Example of disorders that result in hormonal imbalance include pituitary or testicular cancers; testicular failure to produce sperm, for example due to varicoceles or medical treatments that impair sperm-producing cells (such as chemotherapy); and abnormal sperm function and quality. Conditions or situations that cause abnormal shape (morphology) and movement (motility) of the sperm negatively affect fertility. For example, the use of anabolic steroids can cause abnormal semen parameters such sperm count and shape(1). Lifestyle factors such as smoking, excessive alcohol intake and obesity can affect fertility. In addition, exposure to environmental pollutants and toxins can be directly toxic to gametes (eggs and sperm), resulting in their decreased numbers and poor quality(1,2)..",

Influenza A viruses are established in many animal species. The emergence of an influenza A virus, with the ability to infect people and sustain human-to-human transmission, could cause an influenza pandemic. Influenza type A viruses are classified into subtypes according to the combinations of the proteins on the surface of the virus. When animal influenza viruses infect their host species, they are named according to the host  as avian influenza viruses, swine influenza viruses, equine influenza viruses, canine influenza viruses, etc. These animal influenza viruses are distinct from human influenza viruses and do not easily transmit to and among humans. Wild aquatic birds are the primary natural reservoir for most subtypes of influenza A viruses. Avian influenza outbreaks in poultry can have immediate and severe consequences for the agricultural sector..",

Influenza spreads easily between people when they cough or sneeze. Vaccination is the best way to prevent the disease. Symptoms of influenza include acute onset of fever, cough, sore throat, body aches and fatigue. Treatment should aim to relieve symptoms. People with the flu should rest and drink plenty of liquids. Most people will recover on their own within a week. Medical care may be needed in severe cases and for people with risk factors. There are 4 types of influenza viruses, types A, B, C and D. Influenza A and B viruses circulate and causeseasonal epidemicsof disease. Influenza A virusesare further classified into subtypes according to the combinations of the proteins on the surface of the virus. Currently circulating in humans are subtype A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) influenza viruses. The A(H1N1) is also written as A(H1N1)pdm09 as it caused the pandemic in 2009 and replaced the previous A(H1N1) virus which had circulated prior to 2009. Only influenza type A viruses are known to have caused pandemics. Influenza B virusesare not classified into subtypes but can be broken down into lineages. Influenza type B viruses belong to either BYamagata or BVictoria lineage. Influenza C virusis detected less frequently and usually causes mild infections, thus does not present public health importance.

For these reasons, preventing injuries and violence, including by breaking intergenerational cycles of violence, goes beyond avoiding the physical injury to contributing to substantial health, social and economic gains. Injuries and violence are a significant cause of death and burden of disease in all countries; however, they are not evenly distributed across or within countries  some people are more vulnerable than others depending on the conditions in which they are born, grow, work, live and age. For instance, in general, being young, male and of low socioeconomic status all increase the risk of injury and of being a victim or perpetrator of serious physical violence. The risk of fall-related injuries increases with age. Twice as many males than females are killed each year as a result of injuries and violence. Worldwide, about three quarters of deaths from road traffic injuries, four fifths of deaths from homicide, and two thirds of deaths from war are among men. In many low- and middle-income countries, however, women and girls are more likely to be burned than men and boys, in large part due to exposure to unsafe cooking arrangements and energy poverty. Across all ages, the three leading causes of death from injuries for males are road traffic injuries, homicide and suicide, while for females they are road traffic injuries, falls and suicide. Poverty also increases the risk of injury and violence. About 90% of injury-related deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Across the world, injury death rates are higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries. Even within countries, people from poorer economic backgrounds have higher rates of fatal and non-fatal injuries than people from wealthier economic backgrounds. This holds true even in high-income countries. The uneven distribution of injuries that makes them more prevalent among the less advantaged is related to several risk factors. These include living, working, travelling and going to school in more precarious conditions, less focus on prevention efforts in underprivileged communities, and poorer access to quality emergency trauma care and rehabilitation services. These issues are explained in more detail below..",

As the disease progresses, in severe cases facial swelling, fluid in the lung cavity, bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina or gastrointestinal tract and low blood pressure may develop. Shock, seizures, tremor, disorientation, and coma may be seen in the later stages. Among hospitalized patients, approximately 15% die of Lassa fever disease. In fatal cases, death usually occurs within 14 days of symptom onset. During pregnancy, Lassa fever can cause high maternal and foetal mortality, especially late in pregnancy. In the third trimester, fetal death and maternal death rates can exceed 80% and 30% respectively. Recovery can take a long time (prolonged convalescence) and sometimes leads to other conditions (sequelae). Sudden hearing loss has been reported with varying incidence and up to 25% of recovered patients, both during acute disease and after recovery. In most circumstances hearing loss is reported to be permanent. Other sequelae including neurological signs, visual impairment, joint pain, transient hair loss and psychological disorders have been reported to a lesser extent. Therefore, patients who have recovered from Lassa fever should receive care for sequelae they may experience..",

Treatments for non-specific LBP include: physical therapies to improve muscle strength and ability to move and resume physical activity and exercise psychological and social support to help people manage their pain and return to doing activities they enjoy reducing strain during physical work lifestyle changes including more physical activity, healthy diet and good sleep habits. Medicines can be used to reduce the symptoms of LBP and should ideally be combined with other treatments. Painkillers should not be the first-line treatment for LBP. Older people and those with other medical conditions should speak to a healthcare provider before using medicines. With the onset of any LBP, a comprehensive clinical assessment comprising a careful physical examination and a psychosocial assessment is essential to tailor care while considering a persons values, preferences and care priorities. The longer a person experiences LBP, the more likely that limitations in functioning will manifest. In these contexts, adopting a biopsychosocial approach to assessment and care planning becomes increasingly important. Rehabilitation includes sets of interventions that aim to achieve and maintain independence in daily living and optimal participation in meaningful activities, such as work and community life and to achieve well-being. Interventions for rehabilitation in LBP include non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic options, whereas non-pharmacological interventions have in most cases a high priority..",

Symptoms of lung cancer include a cough that does not go away, chest pain and shortness of breath. It is important to seek medical care early to avoid serious health effects. Treatments depend on the persons medical history and the stage of the disease. The most common types of lung cancer are non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC) and small cell carcinoma (SCLC). NSCLC is more common and grows slowly, while SCLC is less common but often grows quickly. Lung cancer is a significant public health concern, causing a considerable number of deaths globally. GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) show as lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%) in 2020. Smoking tobacco (including cigarettes, cigars, and pipes) is the primary risk factor for lung cancer but it can also affect non-smokers. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, occupational hazards (such as asbestos, radon and certain chemicals), air pollution, hereditary cancer syndromes, and previous chronic lung diseases..",

When lymphatic filariasis develops into chronic conditions it leads to lymphoedema (tissue swelling) or elephantiasis (skintissue thickening) of limbs and hydrocele (scrotal swelling). Involvement of breasts and genital organs is common. Such body deformities often lead to social stigma and sub-optimal mental health, loss of income-earning opportunities and increased medical expenses for patients and their caretakers. The socioeconomic burdens of isolation and poverty are immense. Acute episodes of local inflammation involving skin, lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels often accompany chronic lymphoedema or elephantiasis. Some of these episodes are caused by the bodys immune response to the parasite. Most are the result of secondary bacterial skin infection where normal defenses have been partially lost due to underlying lymphatic damage. These acute attacks are debilitating, may last for weeks and are the primary cause of lost wages among people suffering with lymphatic filariasis..",

    "text": "Elimination of lymphatic filariasis is possible by stopping the spread of the infection through preventive chemotherapy. The WHO recommended preventive chemotherapy strategy for lymphatic filariasis elimination is mass drug administration (MDA). MDA involves administering an annual dose of medicines to the entire at-risk population. The medicines used have a limited effect on adult parasites but effectively reduce the density of microfilariae in the bloodstream and prevent the spread of parasites to mosquitoes. The MDA regimen recommended depends on the co-endemicity of lymphatic filariasis with other filarial diseases. WHO recommends the following MDA regimens: albendazole (400 mg) alone twice per year for areas co-endemic with loiasis; ivermectin (200 mcgkg) with albendazole (400 mg) in countries with onchocerciasis; diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) (6 mgkg) and albendazole (400 mg) in countries without onchocerciasis; and ivermectin (200 mcgkg) together with diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) (6 mgkg) and albendazole (400 mg) in countries without onchocerciasis and where other programmatic conditions are met. The impact of MDA depends on the efficacy of the regimen and the coverage (proportion of total population ingesting the medicines). MDA with the 2-medicine regimens have interrupted the transmission cycle when conducted annually for at least 46 years with effective coverage of the total population at risk. Salt fortified with DEC has also been used in a few unique settings to interrupt the transmission cycle. At the start of GPELF, 81 countries were considered endemic for lymphatic filariasis. Further epidemiological data reviewed since, indicate that preventive chemotherapy was not required in 10 countries. From 2000 to 2023, 9.7 billion cumulative treatments were delivered to more than 943 million people at least once in 71 countries, considerably reducing transmission in many places. The population requiring MDA has declined by 58.6% (871 million) where infection prevalence has been reduced below elimination thresholds. The overall economic benefit of the programme during 20002007 is conservatively estimated at US 24 billion. Treatments until 2015 are estimated to have averted at least US 100.5 billion of economic loss expected to have occurred over the lifetime of cohorts who have benefited from treatment. Twenty-one countries and territories (Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, the Cook Islands, Egypt, Kiribati, Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, Maldives, Malawi, Marshall Islands, Niue, Palau, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Vanuatu, Viet Nam, Wallis and Futuna, and Yemen) are now acknowledged as achieving elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem.",

Both viruses are part of theFiloviridaefamily (filovirus) to whichOrthoebolavirusgenus belongs. Though caused by different viruses, Ebola and Marburg diseases are clinically similar. Both diseases are rare but have the capacity to cause outbreaks with high fatality rates. MVD was initially detected in 1967 after two simultaneous outbreaks in Marburg and Frankfurt in Germany, and in Belgrade, Serbia. These outbreaks were associated with laboratory work using African green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) imported from Uganda. Subsequently, outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, South Africa (in a person with recent travel history to Zimbabwe), Tanzania and Uganda. In 2008, two independent cases were reported in travellers who had visited a cave inhabited byRousettus aegyptiacusbat colonies in Uganda.

Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body. Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people. The vaccine is safe and helps your body fight off the virus. Before the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination, major epidemics occurred approximately every two to three years and caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year. An estimated 107 500 people died from measles in 2023  mostly children under the age of five years, despite the availability of a safe and cost-effective vaccine. Accelerated immunization activities by countries, WHO, the Measles  Rubella Partnership (formerly the Measles  Rubella Initiative), and other international partners successfully prevented an estimated 60 million deaths between 20002023.

They include: running nose cough red and watery eyes small white spots inside the cheeks. The rash begins about 718 days after exposure, usually on the face and upper neck. It spreads over about 3 days, eventually to the hands and feet. It usually lasts 56 days before fading. Most deaths from measles are from complications related to the disease. Complications can include: blindness encephalitis (an infection causing brain swelling and potentially brain damage) severe diarrhoea and related dehydration ear infections severe breathing problems including pneumonia. If a woman catches measles during pregnancy, this can be dangerous for the mother and can result in her baby being born prematurely with a low birth weight. Complications are most common in children under 5 years and adults over age 30. They are more likely in children who are malnourished, especially those without enough vitamin A or with a weak immune system from HIV or other diseases. Measles itself also weakens the immune system and can make the body forget how to protect itself against infections, leaving children extremely vulnerable..",

Menopause is caused by the loss of ovarian follicular function and a decline in circulating blood oestrogen levels. The menopausal transition can be gradual, usually beginning with changes in the menstrual cycle. Perimenopause refers to the period from when these signs are first observed and ends one year after the final menstrual period.

This means that the ovaries stop releasing eggs for fertilization. The regularity and length of the menstrual cycle varies across a womans reproductive life span, but the age at which natural menopause occurs is generally between 45 and 55 years for women worldwide. Natural menopause is deemed to have occurred after 12 consecutive months without menstruation for which there is no other obvious physiological or pathological cause and in the absence of clinical intervention. Some women experience menopause earlier (before 40 years of age). This premature menopause may be because of certain chromosomal abnormalities, autoimmune disorders or other unknown causes. It is not possible to predict when an individual woman will experience menopause, although there are associations between the age at menopause and certain demographic, health and genetic factors. Menopause can also be induced as a consequence of surgical procedures that involve removal of both ovaries or medical interventions that cause cessation of ovarian function (for example radiation therapy or chemotherapy). Many women have already stopped menstruating before menopause, for example those who have had certain surgical procedures (hysterectomy or surgical removal of their uterine lining) as well as those using certain hormonal contraceptives and other medicines that cause infrequent or absent periods.

WHO is committed to increasing understanding of menopause by: raising awareness of menopause and its impact on women at individual and societal levels, as well as on countries health and socioeconomic development; advocating for the inclusion of diagnosis, treatment and counselling related to management of menopausal symptoms as part of universal health coverage; promoting the inclusion of training on menopause and treatment options in pre-service curricula for health workers; and emphasizing a life course approach to health and well-being (including sexual health and well-being), by ensuring that women have access to appropriate health information and services to promote healthy ageing and a high quality of life before, during and after menopause. Notes 1) Whilst most personal experiences with menopause relate to cisgender women (who were born female and identify as female), transgender men and some people who identify as neither men nor women also experience menopause. This fact sheet refers to women in alignment with the available data, which does not routinely identify gender identity. There is a paucity of readily available data on trans and gender diverse experiences of menopause. Trans and gender diverse people have unique age-related health needs that clinicians should consider, including referral to specialist services when necessary. 2) Although menopause is not a disease, this fact sheet refers to the perimenopausal and postmenopausal experiences of women as symptoms because they can result in a level of discomfort that affects their quality of life.

It has intrinsic and instrumental value and is a basic human right. Mental health exists on a complex continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the next. At any one time, a diverse set of individual, family, community and structural factors may combine to protect or undermine mental health. Although most people are resilient, people who are exposed to adverse circumstances are at higher risk of developing a mental health condition. Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm. Many mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively low cost, yet health systems remain significantly under-resourced and treatment gaps are wide all over the world..",

This is best achieved through community-based mental health care, which is more accessible and acceptable than institutional care, helps prevent human rights violations, and delivers better recovery outcomes. Such care should be provided through a coordinated network of services that comprise: integrated mental health services within general health care, typically in general hospitals and through task-sharing with non-specialist care providers in primary health care; dedicated community mental health services, such as community mental health centres and teams, psychosocial rehabilitation, peer support and supported living; and mental health support in non-health settings, including child protection services, school health programmes, and prisons. The vast care gap for common mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety means countries must also explore innovative approaches to expand and diversify care.

Human activity is the main cause of mercury releases, particularly coal-fired power stations, residential coal burning for heating and cooking, industrial processes, waste incinerators and as a result of mining for mercury, gold and other metals. Once in the environment, mercury can be transformed by bacteria into methylmercury. Methylmercury then bioaccumulates (bioaccumulation occurs when an organism contains higher concentrations of the substance than do the surroundings) in fish and shellfish. For example, large predatory fish are more likely to have high levels of mercury as a result of eating many smaller fish..",

Mercury exists in various forms: elemental (or metallic); inorganic (e.g. mercuric chloride); and organic (e.g. methyl- and ethylmercury), which all have different toxic effects, including on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, and on lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes. The health impacts of mercury are numerous including kidney and nervous system damage and skin problems. Exposure of the fetus to methylmercury poses danger to the unborn child. The inorganic salts of mercury are corrosive to the skin, eyes and gastrointestinal tract, and may induce kidney toxicity if ingested. Neurological and behavioural disorders may be observed after inhalation, ingestion or dermal exposure of different mercury compounds. Symptoms include tremors, insomnia, memory loss, neuromuscular effects, headaches and cognitive and motor dysfunction. Mild, subclinical signs of central nervous system toxicity can be seen in workers exposed to an elemental mercury level in the air of 20 \u03bcgm3 or more for several years. Kidney effects have been reported, ranging from increased protein in the urine to kidney failure..",

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Typical MERS symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is common, but MERS patients may not always develop this condition. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported among MERS patients. Approximately 35% of MERS cases reported to WHO have died. MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus, meaning it is transmitted between animals and people. MERS-CoV has been identified and linked to human infections in dromedary camels in several Member States in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. Human-to-human transmission is possible and has occurred predominantly among close contacts and in health care settings. Outside the health care setting, there has been limited human-to-human transmission..",

A typical presentation of MERS is fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but MERS patients may not always develop this condition. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation or support in an intensive care unit. Older people, people with weakened immune systems, and those with chronic diseases such as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes appear to be at greater risk of developing severe disease. Approximately 35% of cases reported to WHO have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS may be missed by existing surveillance systems. Since the identification of MERS-CoV in 2012, 27 Member States have reported cases of MERS to WHO under the International Health Regulations (2005): Algeria, Austria, Bahrain, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Oman, Philippines, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Tunisia, T\u00fcrkiye, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of America, and Yemen..",

WHO is also working with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) and national governments to develop public health prevention strategies to limit zoonotic transmission and amplification in humans, including the development of human and dromedary camel vaccine candidates. Together with affected Member States and international technical partners and networks, WHO is coordinating the global health response to MERS, including: the provision of updated information on the epidemiological situation; conducting risk assessments and joint investigations with national authorities; convening scientific meetings; and developing technical guidance and training materials for health authorities and technical health agencies. The DirectorGeneral first convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) in 2013 to provide advice as to whether the outbreaks of MERS constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and on the public health measures that should be taken. The Committee has met on ten occasions and, on each occasion, the Committee has concluded that the outbreaks do not meet the criteria of a PHEIC. WHO continues to strongly encourage all Member States maintain surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), including MERS in Member States where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camels, and to carefully review any unusual patterns in SARI or pneumonia cases. Both affected and at-risk Member States should maintain a high level of vigilance, especially those with large numbers of travellers or migrant workers returning from the Middle East. Surveillance should continue to be enhanced in affected Member States according to WHO guidance, along with infection prevention and control procedures in health care facilities. Under the provisions of the International Health Regulations (2005), WHO continues to request that Member States report to WHO all confirmed and probable cases of infection with MERS-CoV, as well as information about exposure(s), testing, and clinical course to inform preparedness and response activities and guidance..",

Common symptoms of mpox are: rash fever sore throat headache muscle aches back pain low energy swollen lymph nodes. For some people, the first symptom of mpox is a rash, while others may have fever, muscle aches or sore throat first. The mpox rash often begins on the face and spreads over the body, extending to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It can also start on other parts of the body where contact was made, such as the genitals. It starts as a flat sore, which develops into a blister filled with liquid that may be itchy or painful. As the rash heals, the lesions dry up, crust over and fall off. Some people may have one or a few skin lesions and others have hundreds or more. These can appear anywhere on the body including: palms of hands and soles of feet face, mouth and throat groin and genital areas anus. Some people also have painful swelling of their rectum (proctitis) or pain and difficulty when peeing (dysuria) or when swallowing. People with mpox can pass the disease on to others until all sores have healed and a new layer of skin has formed. Some people can be infected without developing any symptoms. Although getting mpox from someone who is asymptomatic (not showing symptoms) has been reported, information is still limited on how common it is. Children, pregnant people and people with weak immune systems, including people living with HIV that is not well controlled, are at higher risk for serious illness and death due to complications from mpox. Some people with mpox become very sick. For example, the skin can become infected with bacteria, leading to abscesses or serious skin damage. Other complications include pneumonia; corneal infection with loss of vision; pain or difficulty swallowing; vomiting and diarrhoea causing dehydration or malnutrition; and infections of the blood (sepsis), brain (encephalitis), heart (myocarditis), rectum (proctitis), genital organs (balanitis) or urinary passages (urethritis).

Groups that may be at high risk of mpox include: health and care workers at risk of exposure; people in the same household or close community as someone who has mpox, including children; people who have multiple sex partners, including men who have sex with men; and sex workers of any gender and their clients. The vaccine can also be administered after a person has been in contact with someone who has mpox (post-exposure prophylaxis). In these cases, the vaccine should be given less than 4 days after contact with someone who has mpox. The vaccine can be given for up to 14 days if the person has not developed symptoms. Some antivirals have received emergency use authorization in some countries and are being evaluated in clinical trials. To date, there is no proven effective antiviral treatment for mpox. It is a priority to continue evaluation of therapeutics in robust clinical trials and to focus on optimizing supportive care for patients.

Things to do to help the symptoms and prevent transmitting mpox to others: Do contact your health care provider for advice; stay at home and in your own, well-ventilated room if possible; wash hands often with soap and water or hand sanitizer, especially before or after touching sores; wear a mask and cover lesions when around other people until your rash heals; keep skin dry and uncovered (unless in a room with someone else); avoid touching items in shared spaces and disinfect shared spaces frequently; use saltwater rinses for sores in the mouth; take warm baths with baking soda or Epsom salts for body sores; and take over-the-counter medications for pain like paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen. Do not pop blisters or scratch sores, which can slow healing, spread the rash to other parts of the body, and cause sores to become infected; or shave areas with sores until scabs have healed and you have new skin underneath (this can spread the rash to other parts of the body). To prevent spread of mpox to others, people with mpox should isolate at home following guidance from their health care provider, or in hospital if needed, for the duration of the infectious period (from onset of symptoms until lesions have healed and scabs fall off). Covering lesions and wearing a well-fitting mask when in the presence of others may help prevent spread. Using condoms during sex will help reduce the risk of getting mpox but will not prevent spread from skin-to-skin or mouth-to-skin contact. If having sex, use condoms as a precaution for 12 weeks (about 3 months) after you have recovered. Taking a break from sexual activity with new partners during periods of increased transmission can reduce the risk of getting mpox. Those who have had contact with someone with mpox should monitor for signs and symptoms for 21 days (3 weeks) and take precautions such as avoiding sexual activity during this period. Health workers should follow infection prevention and control measures to protect themselves while caring for patients with mpox by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (i.e. gloves, gown, eye protection and respirator) and adhering to protocol for safely swabbing lesions for diagnostic testing and handling sharp objects such as needles..",

Both should be approached in the wider contexts of global control of antimicrobial resistance. WHO is implementing the Global Action Plan to Control the Spread and Impact of Antimicrobial Resistance inN. gonorrhoeaeto facilitate effective actions against the spread of multi-drug resistantN. gonorrhoeae. This Plan is part of the greater STI surveillance plan to help early detection of emerging resistant strains, combined with a public health response to prevent and treat gonococcal infections and reduce the impact of gonorrhoea on sexual and reproductive health. TheGlobal Health Sector Strategy on HIV, Hepatitis and STIs (20222030)has set targets to reduce the number of new cases of gonorrhoea among people 1549 years old from 82.3 million per year in 2020 to 8.23 million per year in 2030, thus reducing the year incidence by 90% by 2030. Recognizing that this reduction may be difficult to achieve with available interventions, and given increasing antimicrobial resistance, the strategy has emphasized the need to develop effective gonococcal vaccines. No currently licensed gonococcal vaccines exist. However, interest in gonococcal vaccine development has been reinvigorated not only by the marked increases in gonococcal antimicrobial resistance, but also by mounting scientific evidence suggesting gonococcal vaccines are biologically feasible. The key WHO actions are: effective prevention and control of gonococcal infections, using prevention messages and interventions and appropriate treatment regimens; establish effective drug regulations; strengthen surveillance systems for antimicrobial resistance, especially in countries with a high burden of gonococcal infections and to expand more countries (70% by 2030 compared to 36% in 2020) reporting antimicrobial resistance inN. gonorrhoeaeto the WHO Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme; strengthen the Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme by establishing a network of laboratories to coordinate gonococcal antimicrobial resistance surveillance linked to the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System; establish regional networks of laboratories that can perform gonococcal culture, with good quality control mechanisms; ensure appropriate and quality STI case management and where feasible same-day testing and treatment; monitor treatment failures by developing a standard set of protocols for monitoring; support research to find low-cost tests to identifyN. gonorrhoeae, which would allow effectivescreeningin priority populations defined by individual countries including men who have sex with men, sex workers and other priority populations; support research to develop methods for detecting antimicrobial resistance; and research into alternative treatments for gonococcal infections.",

MS can present in a variety of ways including: clinically isolated syndrome (CIS): describes an episode of neurologic symptoms that are the first clinical sign of possible MS; relapsing remitting (RRMS): the most common form of MS characterized by intermittent attacks of symptoms (relapses), followed by a short or long period of no clinical attacks (remissions); secondary progressive (SPMS): after living with RRMS for a long period of time, relapses decrease and symptoms continue progressively without relapses or remissions; and primary progressive (PPMS): starting from the initial symptoms, the disease gradually progresses and gets worse without any clear relapses or remissions. MS is not always easy to diagnose in its early stages. Typically, people who have been diagnosed with MS will have been through several diagnostic stages, which can be an unsettling and frightening experience..",

The goals of MS treatment are to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, slow disease progression, manage symptoms, and improve quality of life. Specific MS disease modifying therapies (DMTs) are started as early as possible to slow disease progression and prevent relapses. Steroids are sometimes used in the short term to treat relapses. Other medicines can be used to reduce the symptoms of MS such as fatigue, muscle tightening, depression and urinary or sexual problems. These medicines do not change the course of the disease but help manage the symptoms. Rehabilitation specialists can help improve functioning, quality of life and reduce muscle stiffness and spasms. Many people feel fatigue with multiple sclerosis. Ways to manage fatigue include: regular exercise healthy sleep patterns avoiding medicines that make fatigue worse. In the past twenty years treatment options for MS have improved dramatically. In high income countries many oral, intravenous and injectable options exist to treat MS. However, most of these medications are not available in low- and middle-income countries and there is still a lack of treatment options for progressive types of MS. People with MS and their families should be encouraged to seek services and guidance from local and national Organizations of Disabled People (ODPs) and other disability focused organizations, which can provide vital advice about legal rights, economic opportunities and social engagement to ensure that people disabled by MS or other neurological disorders are able to live full and rewarding lives..",

Rehabilitation should be available for all the population, through all stages of the life course and along the continuum of care. This includes all people with musculoskeletal conditions. Efforts to strengthen rehabilitation should be directed towards supporting health systems as a whole and integrating rehabilitation into all levels of health care. WHO is also developing a Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation including the following musculoskeletal conditions: low back pain, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcopenia, fractures in the extremities, and amputation. Each package will contain a list of essential interventions for rehabilitation and the resources required to deliver them safely and effectively. These interventions will be relevant for people at all stages of life, along the continuum of care, across all service delivery platforms, and across all world regions, with a specific focus on low- and middle-resource contexts. The main target users of the Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation are Ministries of Health that can use this resource to plan and budget the integration of rehabilitation in their national health services. Other target users that may benefit from the Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation include researchers to identify rehabilitation research gaps; academics to develop curricula for the training of rehabilitation professionals; and service providers to plan and implement specific interventions in their rehabilitation programmes. More about the Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation of musculoskeletal conditions can be foundhere. Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) Integrated care for older people (ICOPE) reflects a continuum of care that helps to reorient health and social services towards a more person-centred and coordinated model of care to optimize older peoples intrinsic capacity (physical and mental capacities) and functional ability. Locomotor (musculoskeletal) capacity is a key component of intrinsic capacity. Delivery of integrated care and primary health services responsive to older people is one of the action areas ofUN Decade of Healthy Ageing (20212030).

Its pathogenesis is linked with non-specific polymicrobial organisms and a range of modifiable risk factors and underlying social determinants shared with other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Noma mainly affects children aged 26 years old and is found most commonly among those living in poor communities. Africa is the most affected continent, although cases have also been reported in Asia, the Americas and other regions. Thelatest WHO estimateson burden of disease date to 1998, with an estimated 140 000 incident cases per year and a prevalence of 770 000 cases. The case-fatality rate was estimated at 90%, although evidence shows that this can be greatly reduced by early treatment. Accurate estimations of nomas burden are challenging, as many cases go undiagnosed, untreated and unreported due to the fast progression of the disease, high case-fatality rate, weak health systems including surveillance, associated stigma and lack of awareness of noma by healthcare workers and caregivers. Affected children that survive the diseases are often left with serious aesthetic and functional consequences including disfigurement and impairments in breathing, swallowing, speaking and vision that further contribute to their social isolation, stigmatization, discrimination, and consequently to violations of their human rights..",

Noma can also occur among immunocompromised adults due to HIV, leukaemia and other diseases(2). The disease, also called cancrum oris or gangrenous stomatitis, is mostly found in sub-Saharan Africa, although cases have also been reported in Latin America, Asia and other regions. Noma starts as a soft tissue lesion (a sore) of the gums. It then develops into an acute necrotizing gingivitis that progresses rapidly, destroying the soft tissues and further progressing to involve the hard tissues and skin of the face. Noma is generally considered an opportunistic and non-contagious disease. Survivors suffer from severe facial disfigurement, have difficulty speaking and eating, endure social stigma, and require complex surgery and rehabilitation. When noma is detected at an early stage, its progression can be rapidly halted through basic hygiene, antibiotics and improved nutrition..",

More severe cases may warrant surgical intervention and wound dressing.Once noma reaches the gangrenous stage of the disease with a visible hole in the face, it is likely that children who survive will suffer severe facial disfigurement, have difficulty eating and speaking, face social stigma and isolation, and need reconstructive surgery..",

This programme focuses on strengthening and developing the capacities of health workers, social actors and communities to prevent, promptly detect and manage cases of noma.Improved awareness of the disease among populations and mental health counsellinghelps to remove stigma and enhances the reintegration of noma survivors and their families into society. Integration of noma into existing health surveillance systems can improve data availability and accessibility and strengthen the leadership of ministries of health through improved inter- and multisectoral collaboration. Moreover,WHO has encouraged Member Statesto take a more integrated approach to preventing and controlling noma, caused by a range of modifiable risk factors, and their underlying social determinants shared with NTDs. Following a recommendation of the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Neglected Tropical Diseases (STAG-NTD), noma was added to the WHO list of NTDs in December 2023, with a view to integrate noma within theroad map for neglected tropical diseases 20212030. Through this process WHO is committed to support advocacy efforts, mobilization of resources for research and development and implementation of interventions directed against noma, in coordination with NTD programmes at national level. Even prior to this decision, noma was linked to fieldwork implemented against the skin NTDs (and other skin diseases), and was included in technical products and resources such as theOpenWHO course on tropical dermatologyand theSkinNTD mobile application. A dedicated online course on noma is currently available inEnglish,French,Hausa,Hindi, andPortuguese. References 1. Srour, M. L., Marck, K.,  Baratti-Mayer, D.

That will bring the a global shortage of health workers estimated for 2030 to 4.8 million nurses and midwives, with the greatest gaps found in countries in Africa, South-East Asia and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, as well as some parts of Latin America(1). Nurses and midwives play a pivotal role in improving health and contributing to the wider economy.Investing in them is imperativeto achieve efficient, effective, resilient and sustainable health systems. They not only provide essential care but also play a critical role in shaping health policies and driving primary health care. Nurses and midwives deliver care in emergency settings and safeguard the sustainability of health systems globally. Globally,67% of the health and social workforce are womencompared to 41% in all employment sectors. Nursing and midwifery occupations represent a significant share of the female workforce. More than 80%of the worlds nurses work in countries that are home to half of the worlds population. And one in every eight nurses practices in a country other than the one where they were born or trained. Higher levels of female nurses arepositively correlatedwith health service coverage, and life expectancy and negatively correlated with infant mortality..",

They are also part of their local community  sharing its culture, strengths and vulnerabilities  and can shape and deliver effective interventions to meet the needs of patients, families and communities. WHO response WHOs work relating to nursing and midwifery is currently directed byWorld Health Assembly resolution WHA74.15(2021) which calls on WHO Member States and WHO to strengthen nursing and midwifery through theGlobal Strategic Directions for Nursing and Midwifery (SDNM) 20212025. The SDNM is an interrelated set of policy priorities that can help countries to ensure that midwives and nurses optimally contribute to achieving universal health coverage (UHC) and other population health goals. The SDNM comprises four policy focus areas: education, jobs, leadership, and service delivery Each area has a strategic direction articulating a goal for the five-year period,and includes between two and four policy priorities If enacted and sustained, these policy priorities can support advancement along the four strategic directions: 1) educating enough midwives and nurses with competencies to meet population health needs; 2) creating jobs, managing migration, and recruiting and retaining midwives and nurses where they are most needed; 3) strengthening nursing and midwifery leadership throughout health and academic systems; and 4) ensuring midwives and nurses are supported, respected, protected, motivated and equipped to safely and optimally contribute in their service delivery settings. WHO engages ministries of health, the Government Chief Nurses and Midwives (GCNMOs) and other relevant stakeholders to enable effective planning, coordination and management of nursing and midwifery programmes in countries. The Global Forum for the Government Chief Nurses and Midwives, established in 2004, is organized by WHO and meets every two years. It is a Forum for senior nursing and midwifery officials to develop and inform areas of shared interest. WHO also engages with academic institutions specialised in nursing and midwifery. Forty-seven academic centres are designated as Collaborating Centres for Nursing and Midwifery with WHO. The academic centres are affiliated to theGlobal Network of WHO Collaborating Centres for Nursing and Midwifery.",

Obesity can lead to increased risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, it can affect bone health and reproduction, it increases the risk of certain cancers. Obesity influences the quality of living, such as sleeping or moving. The diagnosis of overweight and obesity is made by measuring peoples weight and height and by calculating the body mass index (BMI): weight (kg)height\u00b2 (m\u00b2). The body mass index is a surrogate marker of fatness and additional measurements, such as the waist circumference, can help the diagnosis of obesity.

While the level of mortality differs considerably between regions, this age pattern is generally consistent across regions except for Australia and New Zealand, Europe and North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean, which see the lowest mortality among those aged 59 years. However, survival chances for older children and young adolescents vary greatly across the world. In sub-Saharan Africa, the probability of dying among those aged 514 years in 2020 was 26 deaths per 1000 children aged 5 years. Approximately 77% of deaths among those aged 514 years occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and South- East Asia, up from 72% in 1990. The average global probability of a 5-year-old dying before their 14thbirthday was 8 times higher in sub-Saharan Africa than in the WHO Region of the Americas. While preterm birth, birth trauma and infectious diseases cause the most deaths in children under 5 years, injuries (including road traffic injuries and drowning) rank among the top causes of death and lifelong disability among older children and young adolescents aged 514 years. The patterns of death in those aged 5 to 14 years reflect the underlying risk profiles of the age groups, with a shift away from infectious diseases of childhood and towards accidents and injuries. Sex differences in mortality rates become apparent starting in adolescence, with males having higher mortality rates than females. The rise of injury deaths changes the nature of interventions to improve survival for those aged 5 to 14 years. There is a shift from health sector actions to prevent and treat the infectious diseases of early childhood towards other government sectors including education, transportation and road infrastructure, water and sanitation and law enforcement. These sectors need to work together to prevent premature mortality in older children and young adolescents. The evidence on deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 infection is strongly age-dependent, with children and adolescents least effected. Children and young adolescents 5 to 14 years represent approximately 8% of the global cases (9 172 397) and 0.1% of the global deaths (1 444).",

The close links between human, animal and environmental health demand close collaboration, communication and coordination between the relevant sectors. One Health is an approach to optimize the health of humans, animals and ecosystems by integrating these fields, rather than keeping them separate. Some 60% of emerging infectious diseases that are reported globally come from animals, both wild and domestic. Over 30 new human pathogens have been detected in the last 3 decades, 75% of which have originated in animals. Human activities and stressed ecosystems have created new opportunities for diseases to emerge and spread. These stressors include animal trade, agriculture, livestock farming, urbanization, extractive industries, climate change, habitat fragmentation and encroachment into wild areas..",

    "text": "One Health is an integrated, unifying approach to balance and optimize the health of people, animals and ecosystems. It uses the close, interdependent links among these fields to create new surveillance and disease control methods. For example, the way land is used can impact the number of malaria cases. Weather patterns and human-built water controls can affect diseases like dengue. Trade in live, wild animals can increase the likelihood of infectious diseases jumping over to people (called disease spillover). The COVID-19 pandemic put a spotlight on the need for a global framework for improved surveillance and a more holistic, integrated system. Gaps in One Health knowledge, prevention and integrated approaches were seen as key drivers of the pandemic. By addressing the linkages between human, animal and environmental health, One Health is seen as a transformative approach to improved global health. One Health applies to a range of issues, include: antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which happens when germs like bacteria and parasites develop the ability to defeat the drugs designed to kill them and continue growing and spreading; zoonotic diseases, which are infectious diseases that are caused by germs that spread between animals and people, such as Ebola, avian influenza, rabies, etc.; vector-borne diseases, which affect people who get bitten by a vector (mosquitoes, ticks, lice and fleas) and include dengue fever, West Nile virus, Lyme disease and malaria; food safety and foodborne diseases, caused by contamination of food and occur at any stage of the food production, delivery and consumption chain, such as norovirus, salmonella, listeria, etc.; and environmental health, such as water pollution, air pollution and climate change. According to the World Bank, the expected benefit of One Health to the global community was estimated in 2022 to be at least US 37 billion per year. The estimated annual need for expenditure on prevention is less than 10% of these benefits. Since 2003, the world has seen over 15 million human deaths and US 4 trillion in economic losses due to disease and pandemics, as well as immense losses from food and water safety hazards, which are One Health related health threats..",

Opioids are commonly used for the treatment of pain, and include medicines such as morphine, fentanyl and tramadol. Their non-medical use, prolonged use, misuse and use without medical supervision can lead to opioid dependence and other health problems. Due to their pharmacological effects, opioids can cause breathing difficulties, and opioid overdose can lead to death. Worldwide, in 2019 about 600 000 deaths were attributable to drug use. Close to 80% of these deaths are related to opioids, with about 25% of those deaths caused by opioid overdose. There are effective treatment interventions for opioid dependence that can decrease the risk of overdose, yet less than 10% of people who need such treatment are receiving it. The medication naloxone can prevent death from an opioid overdose if administered in time..",

Following the recommendation of WHOs Expert Committee on Drug Dependence(6), a number of synthetic opioids, including fentanyl analogues, have been placed under international control, which means rigorous regulation for their availability. WHO continues to monitor several fentanyl analogues through its surveillance system for new psychoactive substances, alerting countries to the potential dangers associated with these substances. Collection of such data is important as information about the patterns of use, misuse and non-medical use of opioids is very limited. WHO also supports countries in monitoring trends in drug use and related harm, to better understand the scale of opioid dependence and opioid overdose. WHO recommends that naloxone be made available to people likely to witness an opioid overdose, as well as training in the management of opioid overdose. In suspected opioid overdose, first responders should focus on airway management, assisting ventilation and administering naloxone. After successful resuscitation following the administration of naloxone, the level of consciousness and breathing of the affected person should be closely observed until full recovery has been achieved. WHO recommends the use of a range of treatment options for opioid dependence. These include opioid agonist maintenance treatment (with medicines such as methadone and buprenorphine), which has the strongest evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, as well as psychosocial treatment and support, and pharmacological treatment with opioid antagonists (such as naltrexone). WHO supports countries in improving the coverage and quality of treatment programmes for opioid dependence and introducing them where they do not already exist. WHO also issues normative guidance to promote the appropriate use of opioids for pain and palliative care. Appropriate use and regulation of opioid analgesics ensures that they are available where needed whilst preventing their diversion and harm related to misuse. In 2016, under the framework of the WHOUNODC Programme on Drug Dependence Treatment and Care, the Stop Overdose Safely (S-O-S) Initiative was launched, to provide training on recognizing the risk of overdose and providing emergency care in the event of an overdose. As part of this Initiative, a multi-site study on community management of opioid overdose was implemented in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Ukraine in 2019-2020.",

The Resolution recommends a shift from the traditional curative approach towards a preventive approach that includes promotion of oral health within the family, schools and workplaces, and includes timely, comprehensive and inclusive care within the primary health-care system. The Resolution affirms that oral health should be firmly embedded within the NCD agenda and that oral health-care interventions should be included in national universal health coverage benefit packages. In response to the mandate outlined in the resolution, the Secretariat developed theGlobal strategy on oral health, adopted in May 2022 (decision WHA75.11), and included theGlobal oral health action plan 20232030 (GOHAP)in the report on NCDs, noted by the Seventy-sixth World Health Assembly in 2023 (WHA76.9). The GOHAP includes a range of actions for Member States, the WHO Secretariat, international partners, civil society organizations and the private sector. In 2024, as an outcome of the first ever WHO Global Oral Health Meeting that took place 2629 November in Bangkok, Thailand, theBangkok Declaration  No Health Without Oral Healthwas adopted. This Declaration advocates for elevating oral diseases as a global public health priority. The Bangkok Declaration reiterates Member States commitment to the landmark 2021 resolution on oral health, which advances the prevention and control of oral diseases as part of the NCD, UHC and environmental agendas. It emphasizes the need to strengthen health systems through primary health care approaches, ensuring that environmental sustainability and climate resilience are central components. References 1.

Symptoms of Oropouche virus disease are similar to those that occur in other diseases, such as dengue and chikungunya, and the cause of infection is often misdiagnosed. In 2024 concerns arose about possible complications of Oropouche virus infection including two deaths in previously healthy infected adults, and of possible negative outcomes of infection during pregnancy with associated fetal death, miscarriage, and microcephaly in newborns, that requires further investigation and research. No specific treatments or vaccines are available for Oropouche virus disease, and patients should receive supportive care.

OROV is a segmented single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the familyPeribunyaviridae,genusOrthobunyavirus, which was first identified in 1955 in Vega de Oropouche, Trinidad and Tobago(1). The virus is transmitted to people through the bite of an infected insect, usually biting midges but also possibly by mosquitoes. It is thus referred to as an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus). Prior to late 2023, reported cases of Oropouche virus disease were limited to South America, mostly near the Amazon rainforest, and the Caribbean. However, since December 2023, cases have been detected in other areas and have become more severe.

The quality of life of caregivers improves as well. Each year, an estimated 56.8 million people, including 25.7 million in the last year of life, are in need of palliative care. Worldwide, only about 14% of people who need palliative care currently receive it. Unnecessarily restrictive regulations for morphine and other essential controlled palliative medicines deny access to adequate palliative care. Adequate national policies, programmes, resources, and training on palliative care among health professionals are urgently needed in order to improve access. The global need for palliative care will continue to grow as a result of the ageing of populations and the rising burden of noncommunicable diseases and some communicable diseases. Early delivery of palliative care reduces unnecessary hospital admissions and the use of health services. Palliative care involves a range of services delivered by a range of professionals that all have equally important roles to play  including physicians, nursing, support workers, paramedics, pharmacists, physiotherapists and volunteers  in support of the patient and their family..",

Common adverse events that may result in avoidable patient harm are medication errors, unsafe surgical procedures, health care-associated infections, diagnostic errors, patient falls, pressure ulcers, patient misidentification, unsafe blood transfusion and venous thromboembolism. Patient harm potentially reduces global economic growth by 0.7% a year. On a global scale, the indirect cost of harm amounts to trillions of US dollars each year (1). Investment in reducing patient harm can lead to significant financial savings, and more importantly better patient outcomes (5).

Many of the older, less costly (off-patent) pesticides, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and lindane, can remain for years in soil and water. These chemicals have been banned by countries which signed the 2001 Stockholm Convention, an international treaty that aims to eliminate or restrict the production and use of persistent organic pollutants. The toxicity of a pesticide depends on its function and other factors. For example, insecticides tend to be more toxic to humans than herbicides. The same chemical can have different effects at different doses, that is, the amount of chemical to which a person is exposed. Toxicity can also depend on the route by which the exposure occurs, such as by swallowing, inhaling or direct contact with the skin. None of the pesticides currently authorized for use on food in international trade are genotoxic (damaging to DNA, which can cause mutations or cancer). Adverse effects from these pesticides occur only above a certain safe level of exposure. When people come into contact with large quantities of pesticide, the result may be acute poisoning or long-term health effects that may include cancer and adverse effects on reproduction..",

However, the effects of exposure to pesticides on humans and the environment are a continuing concern. The use of pesticides to produce food, both to feed local populations and for export, should comply with good agricultural practices regardless of the economic status of a country. Farmers should limit the amount of pesticide used to the minimum necessary to protect their crops. It is also possible, under certain circumstances, to produce food without the use of pesticides..",

Risk assessments for pesticide residues in food are conducted by an independent, international expert scientific group, the Joint FAOWHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR). These assessments are based on all data submitted for national registrations of pesticides worldwide, as well as all scientific studies published in peer-reviewed journals. After assessing the level of risk, JMPR establishes limits for safe intake to ensure that the amount of pesticide residue to which people are exposed through eating food over their lifetime will not result in adverse health effects. These acceptable daily intakes are used by governments and international risk managers, such as the Codex Alimentarius Commission (the intergovernmental body that sets food standards), to establish maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides in food. Codex standards are the reference for international trade in food, meaning that consumers everywhere can be confident that the food they buy meets the agreed standards for safety and quality, no matter where it has been produced. Currently there are Codex standards for more than 100 different pesticides. WHO and FAO have jointly developed theInternational Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management. The most recent edition of this voluntary framework was published in 2014. It guides government regulators, the private sector, civil society and other stakeholders on best practices in managing pesticides throughout their lifecycle, from production to disposal..",

Bubonic plague is the most common form and is characterized by painful swollen lymph nodes or buboes. Plague is transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected tissues, and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets. Plague can be a very severe disease in people, with a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60% for the bubonic type, and is always fatal for the pneumonic kind when left untreated.

Bubonicplague is the most common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. Plague bacillus,Y. pestis, enters at the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it replicates itself. The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a bubo. At advanced stages of the infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores filled with pus. Human to human transmission of bubonic plague is rare. Bubonic plague can advance and spread to the lungs, which is the more severe type of plague called pneumonic plague. Pneumonicplague, or lung-based plague, is the most virulent form of plague. Incubation can be as short as 24 hours. Any person with pneumonic plague may transmit the disease via droplets to other humans. Untreated pneumonic plague, if not diagnosed and treated early, can be fatal. However, recovery rates are high if detected and treated in time (within 24 hours of onset of symptoms)..",

Pneumonia is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. Pneumonia killed 740 180 children under the age of 5 in 2019, accounting for 14% of all deaths of children under 5 years old but 22% of all deaths in children aged 1 to 5 years.

There are symptoms which tend to occur together, for example dizziness, palpitations, light-headedness on standing, and exercise intolerance (related to postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), symptoms of post exertional malaise, or myalgic encephalomyelitischronic fatigue syndrome (MECFS)(7). Other medical conditions can occur more often than usual after having COVID-19. These include kidney impairment, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and mental health disorders, among other conditions(8)..",

To better understand this phenomenon, WHO met with patient advocates, researchers, health-care providers and public health professionals and by September 2020, established emergency international classification of disease (ICD) codes for post COVID-19 condition. Since then, WHO has developed aclinical case definition of post COVID-19 conditionto recognize the condition and its impact on peoples lives. This definition was developed by patients, researchers and clinical experts, representing all WHO regions, with the understanding that the definition may change as new evidence emerges and our understanding of the consequences of COVID-19 evolves. A separateclinical case definition for post COVID-19 condition in children and adolescentsis also available. WHO has been organizing webinars on post COVID-19 condition since February 2021 to expand understanding of the condition and its impact on patients lives, and foster research and collaboration. Aglobal webinar serieson the medical management of post COVID-19 condition is organized each month and has been running since 2023. AWHO Guideline Development Groupconsisting of global experts, frontline providers and affected individuals is presently at work on guidelines on diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation in post COVID-19 condition. We advocate for governments and funders to support research on post COVID-19 condition in the interest of improved understanding of this condition around the world, not just in high-income countries, and design optimal clinical care for patients. National authorities are encouraged to plan and budget for multidisciplinary post COVID-19 condition programmes and to ensure equitable access to relevant therapies. References.",

This can involve them being much more vigilant than usual, for example constantly scanning their surroundings for potential threats or feeling the need to sit with their back against a wall in public places. They may be more easily startled or jumpy, reacting with excessive fear to sudden movements or loud noises. Symptoms of PTSD typically begin immediately after or within one month of a traumatic event. In younger children, symptoms are often behavioural and can include re-enacting the traumatic event during play or in drawings. Children often unjustly blame themselves for what happened. The experience of PTSD can also vary across cultures. For instance, in some cultures, it may be more acceptable to express anger about the event, making this a more prominent experience. In other cultures, people with PTSD may more commonly have physical complaints with unclear causes, such as headaches or gastrointestinal symptoms. People with PTSD may also havedepressive disorder,anxiety disorders andsubstance use disordersas well assuicidal thoughts and behaviours.

Globally, prematurity is the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 years. Inequalities in survival rates around the world are stark. In low-income settings, half of the babies born at or below 32 weeks (2 months early) die due to a lack of feasible, cost-effective care such as warmth, breastfeeding support and basic care for infections and breathing difficulties.

Aclear and simple definitionhas been developed to facilitate the coordination of future PHC efforts at the global, national and local levels and to guide their implementation: PHC is a whole-of-society approach to health that aims at ensuring the highest possible level of health and well-being and their equitable distribution by focusing on peoples needs and as early as possible along the continuum from health promotion and disease prevention to treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care, and as close as feasible to peoples everyday environment. PHC entails three inter-related and synergistic components, including: comprehensive integrated health services that embrace primary care as well as public health goods and functions as central pieces; multi-sectoral policies and actions to address the upstream and wider determinants of health; and engaging and empowering individuals, families and communities for increased social participation and enhanced self-care and self-reliance in health. PHC is rooted in a commitment to social justice, equity, solidarity and participation. It is based on the recognition that the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction. For universal health coverage (UHC) to be truly universal, a shift is needed from health systems designed around diseases and institutions towards health systems designed for people, with people. PHC requires governments at all levels to underscore the importance of action beyond the health sector in order to pursue a whole-of government approach to health, including health-in-all-policies, a strong focus on equity and interventions that encompass the entire life-course. PHC addresses the broader determinants of health and focuses on the comprehensive and interrelated aspects of physical, mental and social health and well-being. It provides whole-person care for health needs throughout the lifespan, not just for a set of specific diseases. Primary health care ensures people receive quality comprehensive care  ranging from promotion and prevention to treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care  as close as feasible to peoples everyday environment..",

It is a viral, zoonotic, neglected tropical disease that causes tens of thousands of deaths annually, with 40% being children under 15. Dog bites and scratches cause 99% of the human rabies cases, and can be prevented through dog vaccination and bite prevention. Once the virus infects the central nervous system and clinical symptoms appear, rabies is fatal in 100% of cases. However, rabies deaths are preventable with prompt post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) by stopping the virus from reaching the central nervous system. PEP consists of thorough wound washing, administration of a course of human rabies vaccine and, when indicated, rabies immunoglobulins (RIG). If a person is bitten or scratched by a potentially rabid animal, they should immediately and always seek PEP care. WHO and its global partners aim to end human deaths from dog-mediated rabies through a comprehensive One Health approach promoting mass dog vaccination, ensuring access to PEP, health worker training, improved surveillance, and bite prevention through community awareness..",

Initial symptoms of rabies include generic signs like fever, pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking, or burning sensations at the wound site. As the virus moves to the central nervous system, progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord develops. Clinical rabies in people can be managed but very rarely cured, and not without severe neurological deficits. There are two forms of rabies: Furious rabiesresults in hyperactivity, excitable behaviour, hallucinations, lack of coordination, hydrophobia (fear of water) and aerophobia (fear of drafts or of fresh air). Death occurs after a few days due to cardio-respiratory arrest. Paralytic rabiesaccounts for about 20% of the total number of human cases. This form of rabies runs a less dramatic and usually longer course than the furious form. Muscles gradually become paralysed, starting from the wound site. A coma slowly develops and eventually death occurs. The paralytic form of rabies is often misdiagnosed, contributing to the under-reporting of the disease..",

Radon can also be found in water. Radon escapes from the ground into the air, where it decays and produces further radioactive particles. As we breathe, these particles are deposited on the cells lining the airways, where they can damage DNA and potentially cause lung cancer. Outdoors, radon quickly dilutes to very low concentrations and is generally not a problem. The average outdoor radon level(1)varies from 5 Bqm3to 15 Bqm3. However, radon concentrations are higher indoors and in areas with minimal ventilation, with highest levels found in places like mines, caves and water treatment facilities. In buildings such as homes, schools, offices, radon levels can vary substantially from 10 Bqm3to more than 10 000 Bqm3.

Put simply, rehabilitation helps a child, adult or older person to be as independent as possible in everyday activities and enables participation in education, work, recreation and meaningful life roles such as taking care of family. It does so by working with the person and their family to address underlying health conditions and their symptoms, modifying their environment to better suit their needs, using assistive products, educating to strengthen self-management, and adapting tasks so that they can be performed more safely and independently. Together, these strategies can help an individual; overcome difficulties with thinking, seeing, hearing, communicating, eating or moving around. Anybody may need rehabilitation at some point in their lives, following an injury, surgery, disease or illness, or because their functioning has declined with age. Some examples of rehabilitation include: speech and language training to improve a persons communication after a brain injury; physical exercise training to improve muscle strength, voluntary movements and balance in persons with stroke or Parkinson disease; modifying an older persons home environment to improve their safety and independence at home and to reduce their risk of falls; educating a person with heart disease on how to exercise safely; preparing a person with an amputation to be able to use a prosthetic and making, fitting and refitting the prosthesis; positioning and splinting techniques to assist with skin healing, reduce swelling, and to regain movement after burn surgery; prescribing medicine to reduce spasticity for a child with cerebral palsy; psychological therapies for a person with emotional distress following a spinal cord injury; Social skills training for persons with schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders or disorders of intellectual disability. training a person with vision loss in the use of a white cane; and working with a patient in intensive care to improve their breathing, prevent complications and speed their recovery after critical illness Rehabilitation is highly person-centred, meaning that the interventions selected for each individual are targeted to their goals and preferences.

    "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common causes of acute lower respiratory infections in children globally, as well as causing substantial burden of severe respiratory disease among elderly persons. Each year RSV causes over 3.6 million hospitalizations and about 100 000 deaths in children under 5 years of age. Most paediatric RSV deaths (97%) occur in low- and middle-income countries where there is limited access to supportive medical care. There are two licensed immunization products for prevention of RSV disease in young infants: a long-acting monoclonal antibody administered to infants soon after birth and a maternal vaccine given to pregnant women and persons in the latter part of pregnancy. Three vaccines are licensed to prevent severe RSV disease in elderly persons and adults with certain underlying illnesses, like lung and heart disease..",

RSV is specific and pathogenic for humans and infects cells along the human respiratory tract, from the nose to the lungs. RSV causes a wide spectrum of respiratory disease, from mild upper respiratory tract infections (in most cases) to life threatening lower respiratory tract infections (2). Infants, especially those under six months of age, are at highest risk of severe RSV disease and death. RSV can also cause severe disease among elderly people and those with underlying illnesses. Until recently, there was no vaccine available to protect infants and elderly people from RSV disease. In the last few years, several vaccines and a long-acting monoclonal antibody have been licensed and are starting to be used to prevent severe RSV disease in these high-risk populations..",

Signs and symptoms consistent with lower respiratory tract infection include: cough shortness of breath fast breathing bronchospasm wheezing. Severe lung disease can result in low oxygen levels in the body, respiratory muscle fatigue and can sometimes result in death. RSV-LRTI in early life may lead to long-term respiratory consequences, including repeat hospitalizations for respiratory illness during infancy, recurrent wheeze andor asthma, and impaired lung health beyond infancy(2).

Several immunization products are currently available to prevent severe RSV disease in infants and elderly adults(7). To protect infants, there is a vaccine given to pregnant women and persons late in pregnancy (WHO recommends third trimester vaccination, defined from 28 weeks gestational age in most settings). Maternal immunization allows transfer of antibodies against RSV through the placenta to the unborn baby, who is then protected for approximately 6 months after birth. Another immunization product to protect babies is a long-acting monoclonal antibody that targets the RSV virus. It is given as an intramuscular injection to protect against severe RSV lower respiratory tract infection lung disease during RSV infection. This product can be administrated to all neonates and infants entering their first RSV season. In addition, countries could consider administering monoclonal antibody to young children (up to 24 months) with high risk of severe RSV disease (e.g. chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, immunocompromised) entering their second RSV season..",

Considering the worldwide impact of RSV disease, theStrategic Group of Experts on Immunizationand WHO, advised that every country should adopt measures to prevent severe RSV in infants. When deciding to use maternal vaccination andor monoclonal antibodies, factors such as cost, funding, supply, expected coverage and the practicality of integrating these measures into the current health-care system should be taken into account. WHO is working with partners to make these products available in low- and middle-income countries. In the future WHO will issue recommendations on vaccines to prevent severe RSV disease in elderly adults. References.",

Early signs and symptoms: pain stiffness tenderness swelling or redness in one or more joints, usually in a symmetrical pattern (e.g., both hands or both feet). The symptoms can worsen over time and spread to more joints including the knees, elbows or shoulders. RA can make it hard to perform daily activities like writing, holding objects with the hands, walking and climbing stairs. People with RA often feel fatigue and general malaise (e.g., fever, poor sleep quality, loss of appetite) and may experience depressive symptoms.

Some patients develop neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, loss of appetite and vomiting. In these patients the disease, in its early stages, may be mistaken for meningitis. The symptoms of RVF usually last from 4 to 7 days, after which time the immune response becomes detectable with the appearance of antibodies and the virus disappears from the blood. A small percentage of patients develop a much more severe form of the disease. This usually appears as one or more of the three following syndromes: Ocular(eye)form(0.52% of patients):symptoms associated with the mild form of the disease are accompanied by retinal lesions. The lesions in the eyes usually appear 1 to 3 weeks after the first symptoms. Patients report blurred or decreased vision. The disease may resolve itself within 10 to 12 weeks. However, when the lesions occur in the macula, 50% of patients will experience a permanent loss of vision. Meningoencephalitis form(less than 1% of patients):The onset of the meningoencephalitis form usually occurs 1 to 4 weeks after the first symptoms of RVF appear. Clinical features include intense headache, loss of memory, hallucinations, confusion, disorientation, vertigo, convulsions, lethargy and coma. Neurological complications can appear two months or more later. While death rate in these patients is low, residual neurological deficit, which may be severe, is common. Haemorrhagic fever form(less than 1% of patients):The symptoms of this form appear 24 days after the onset of illness, and begin with evidence of severe liver impairment. Subsequently signs of haemorrhage then appear such as vomiting blood, passing blood in the faeces, a purpuric rash or ecchymose, bleeding from the nose or gums, menorrhagia and bleeding from venepuncture sites.

Such monitoring gives Member States and donors global data to help decide how to invest in providing toilets and ensuring safe management of wastewater and excreta. WHO works with partners on promoting effective risk assessment and management practices for sanitation in communities and health facilities based on evidence and tools including WHO guidelines on sanitation and health, safe use of wastewater, recreational water quality and promotion of sanitation safety planning and sanitary inspections, and through communities of practice such as RegNet and the sanitation workers initiative.

Most individuals are infected with 1015 mites. People with suppressed immune systems, including people living with HIV, may develop crusted (Norwegian) scabies. This severe infection can have thousands or millions or mites and causes dry, scaley areas on the skin. It often does not cause itch. Crusted scabies spreads very easily and can cause secondary infections. It is life threatening. Scabies mites burrow into the top layer of skin, where the adult female lays eggs. The eggs hatch in 34 days and develop into adult mites in 12 weeks. After 46 weeks the patient develops an allergic reaction to the presence of mite proteins and faeces in the scabies burrow, causing intense itch and rash. Mite effects on immunity, as well as the direct effects of scratching, can lead to inoculation of the skin with bacteria, leading to the development of impetigo (skin sores), especially in the tropics. Impetigo may become complicated by deeper skin infection such as abscesses or serious invasive disease, including septicaemia. In tropical settings, scabies-associated skin infection is a common risk factor for kidney disease and possibly rheumatic heart disease. Evidence of acute renal damage can be found in up to 10% of children with scabies infestation in resource-poor settings and, in many, this persists for years following infection contributing to permanent kidney damage..",

Ivermectin taken orally is also highly effective, but it should not be taken by pregnant women or children who weigh less than 15 kg. Treatments do not kill the parasites eggs, and treatment should be repeated to kill newly hatched mites. People do not experience symptoms in the early stages of infestation. To reduce spread, all people in the household should be treated, even if they do not have symptoms. Other treatments may be needed to treat the complications of scabies. Antiseptics or antibiotics are used to treat bacterial skin infections or impetigo. Patients with crusted scabies are highly infectious and a source of reinfection to the rest of the community. Patients with crusted scabies need intense treatment with both topical and oral medications..",

Liver enlargement is common in advanced cases and is frequently associated with an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity and hypertension of the abdominal blood vessels. In such cases there may also be enlargement of the spleen. The classic sign of urogenital schistosomiasis is haematuria (blood in urine). Kidney damage and fibrosis of the bladder and ureter are sometimes diagnosed in advanced cases. Bladder cancer is another possible complication in the later stages. In women, urogenital schistosomiasis may present with genital lesions, vaginal bleeding, pain during sexual intercourse and nodules in the vulva. In men, urogenital schistosomiasis can induce pathology of the seminal vesicles, prostate and other organs. This disease may also have other long-term irreversible consequences, including infertility. The economic and health effects of schistosomiasis are considerable and the disease disables more than it kills. In children, schistosomiasis can cause anaemia, stunting and a reduced ability to learn, although the effects are usually reversible with treatment. Chronic schistosomiasis may affect peoples ability to work and in some cases can result in death. The number of deaths due to schistosomiasis is difficult to estimate because of hidden pathologies such as liver and kidney failure, bladder cancer and ectopic pregnancies due to female genital schistosomiasis. Deaths due to schistosomiasis are currently estimated at11 792globally per year. However, these figures are likely underestimated and need to be reassessed..",

Schizophrenia is frequently associated with significant distress and impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, and other important areas of life. People with schizophrenia die nine years earlier than the general population (3). This is often due to physical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and infectious diseases. People with schizophrenia often experience human rights violations both inside mental health institutions and in community settings. Stigma against people with this condition is intense and widespread, causing social exclusion, and impacting their relationships with others, including family and friends. This contributes to discrimination, which in turn can limit access to general health care, education, housing, and employment. During humanitarian and public health emergencies, extreme stress and fear, breakdown of social supports, isolation and disruption of health-care services and supply of medication can occur. These changes can have an impact on the lives of people with schizophrenia, such as exacerbation of existing symptoms.

The bodys reaction causes damage to its own tissues and organs and it can lead to shock, multiple organ failure and sometimes death, especially if not recognized early and treated promptly. Sepsis can affect anyone, but people who are older, very young, pregnant or have other health problems are at higher risk. Common signs of sepsis include fever, fast heart rate, rapid breathing, confusion and body pain. It can lead to septic shock, multiple organ failure and death. Sepsis is usually caused by bacterial infections but may be the result of other infections such as viruses, parasites or fungi. Its treatment requires medical care, including the use of antimicrobials, intravenous fluids and other measures. Sepsis acquired in health care settings is one of the most frequent adverse events during care delivery and affect hundreds of millions of patients worldwide every year. Healthcare associated infections are caused by pathogens that are often resistant to drugs and can rapidly lead to deteriorating clinical conditions. Antimicrobial resistance is a major factor determining clinical unresponsiveness to treatment and rapid evolution to sepsis and septic shock. Sepsis patients with resistant pathogens have been found to have a higher risk of hospital mortality. There were an estimated 4.95 million deaths associated with antimicrobial resistance in 2019, including 1.27 million deaths directly attributable to it(5). Implementing preventive measures against infections, such as good hygiene practices, ensuring access to vaccination programmes, improved sanitation and water quality and availability, and other infection prevention and control best practices both in the community and health care settings, are key steps in reducing the occurrence of sepsis. Early diagnosis and timely and appropriate clinical management of sepsis, such as optimal antimicrobial use and fluid resuscitation, are crucial to increase the likelihood of survival. Even though the onset of sepsis can be acute and poses a short-term mortality burden, it can also be the cause of significant long-term morbidity requiring treatment and support. Thus, sepsis requires a multidisciplinary approach..",

In 2020 there were an estimated 374 million new infections in people 1549 years with 1 of 4 curable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomoniasis. An estimated 8 million adults between 15 and 49 years old were infected with syphilis in 2022. An estimated 520 million people aged 1549 years (13%) worldwide have herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection, the main cause of genital herpes(1). Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is associated with over 311 000 cervical cancer deaths each year(2). 1.1 million pregnant women were estimated to be infected with syphilis in 2022, resulting in over 390 000 adverse birth outcomes. STIs have a direct impact on sexual and reproductive health through stigmatization, infertility, cancers and pregnancy complications and can increase the risk of HIV. Drug resistance is a major threat to reducing the burden of gonorrhoea worldwide..",

Some STIs can also be transmitted from mother-to-child during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding, and unsafe blood transfusion. Eight pathogens are linked to the greatest incidence of STIs. Of these, 4 are currently curable: syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis. The other 4 are viral infections: hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus (HSV), HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV). In addition, emerging outbreaks of new infections that can be acquired by sexual contact such as mpox,Shigella sonnei,Neisseria meningitidis, Ebola and Zika, as well as re-emergence of neglected STIs such as lymphogranuloma venereum. These herald increasing challenges in the provision of adequate services for STIs prevention and control..",

For hepatitis B, antivirals can help fighting the virus and slowing damage to the liver. AMR of STIs  in particular gonorrhoea  has increased rapidly in recent years and has reduced treatment options. TheGonococcal AMR Surveillance Programme (GASP)has shown high rates of resistance to many antibiotics including quinolone, azithromycin and extended-spectrum cephalosporins, a last-line treatment(3).

In Asia up to 2 million people are envenomed by snakes each year, while in Africa there are an estimated 435 000 to 580 000 snake bites annually that need treatment. Envenoming affects women, children and farmers in poor rural communities in low- and middle-income countries. The highest burden occurs in countries where health systems are weakest and medical resources sparse. Bites by venomous snakes can cause acute medical emergencies involving severe paralysis that may prevent breathing, cause bleeding disorders that can lead to fatal haemorrhage, cause irreversible kidney failure and severe local tissue destruction that can cause permanent disability and limb amputation. Children may suffer more severe effects and can experience the effects more quickly than adults due to their smaller body mass. In contrast to many other serious health conditions, a highly effective treatment exists. Most deaths and serious consequences of snake bites are entirely preventable by making safe and effective antivenoms more widely available and accessible. High quality snake antivenoms are the most effective treatment to prevent or reverse most of the venomous effects of snake bites.

In December 2015 a programme to evaluate the potential safety and effectiveness of current antivenom products intended for use in sub-Saharan Africa was launched by WHO. This process has subsequently been extended to WHO South-East Asia and to the Eastern Mediterranean Regions. The results of this detailed technical and laboratory assessment provide regulators and procurement agencies with informed guidance on which antivenoms best suit their needs. Following a request by several UN member states, WHO formally listed snakebite envenoming as a highest priority neglected tropical disease in June 2017. ASnakebite Envenoming Working Groupestablished that same year was tasked with informing the development of a strategic WHO road map on snakebites. This strategy focuses on a 50% reduction in mortality and disability caused by snakebite envenoming by 2030. This aim will be achieved through four key objectives: empower and engage communities ensure safe, effective treatment strengthen health systems increase partnerships, coordination and resources. A primer on the WHO response was published in the journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases in February 2019(5). WHO is working closely with a range of partners to ensure the successful implementation of the road map. The strategy focuses on activities in countries and regions where snakebite envenoming occurs, supported by technical units from WHO. A number of large capacity building projects have already been launched. Particular attention is being focused on the development of a community engagement toolkit(6), specific interventions to improve access to WHO-recommended antivenoms(7), strengthen regulation and control of antivenom products and inform rational evidence-based design (link), improved data collection and analysis (link), estimate snake distribution and the risk of snakebite incidence among vulnerable populations using high-resolution geospatial models(8), and integration of snakebite envenoming into the national health plans of affected countries.

Most of our health is determined by these non-medical root causes of ill health, which include quality education, access to nutritious food, and decent housing and working conditions. Wider forces include economic policies and systems, development agendas, social norms, social policies and political systems. Social determinants of health matter because addressing them not only helps prevents illness but also promotes healthy lives and equity. Health follows a social gradient whereby the more deprived the area in which people live, the lower their income, the fewer their years of education, the worse their health and the fewer healthy years they can expect to live. Governance processes need to ensure that policies and systems are developed and implemented to ensure everyone can realize the conditions needed for a healthy and decent life..",

TheGlobal strategy on diet, physical activity, and healthwas adopted in 2004 by the World Health Assembly. It calls on governments, WHO, international partners, the private sector and civil society to act at global, regional, and local levels to support healthy diets and physical activity. In 2010, the World Health Assembly endorsed aset of recommendations on the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children. These recommendations guide countries in designing new policies and strengthening existing ones to reduce the impact of unhealthy food marketing on children. The WHO Regional Offices have developed nutrient profile models that countries can use as a tool to implement these marketing recommendations. In 2011, world leaders committed to reducing peoples exposure to unhealthy diets. The commitment was made through aPolitical Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of NCDs. In 2012, the World Health Assembly adopted6 global nutrition targets, including the reduction of stunting, wasting and overweight in children, the improvement of breastfeeding and the reduction of anaemia and low birth weight. In 2013, the World Health Assembly agreed on9 global voluntary targetsfor the prevention and control of NCDs, which include a halt to the rise in diabetes and obesity and a 30% relative reduction in the intake of salt by 2025.The Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 20132020gives guidance and a menu of policy options for Member States, WHO and other UN agencies to achieve these targets. The timeline for achieving the targets was extended to 2030 by aWorld Health Assembly decision in 2019to ensure its alignment with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In 2023, the firstGlobal report on sodium intake reductionwas published based on theSodium Country Score Card. The report aims to monitor progress and identify areas for action in implementing sodium reduction policies and other measures within Member States and across WHO regions and World Bank income groups.

The extent of SCI related impairment depends on injury severity and location in the spinal cord. SCI results in complete or incomplete loss of sensory andor motor functions below injury level. In paraplegia arm functions are preserved; in tetraplegia they are affected. Autonomic nervous system dysfunction affecting diverse functions can occur at any level of injury. Inappropriate management of SCI related impairments and secondary conditions often causes premature mortality. SCI can diminish the capacity to perform daily activities, including walking, using ones hands, physiological emptying of bowelbladder or washing and dressing oneself. Limitations are compounded by misconceptions, negative attitudes and physical barriers to basic mobility, restricting independence and full societal participation. SCI is a major cause of long-term disability, accounting for over 4.5 million years of life lived with disability (YLDs) in 2021. Importantly, many restrictions in performing activities and participating in meaningful life areas do not result from the condition itself, but from insufficient or inadequate medical care, rehabilitation and assistive technologies access, a high economic burden, and from barriers in the physical, social and policy environments. For example, globally, only 535% have wheelchair access..",

The consumption of free sugars[1] in foods and beverages is the most common risk factor for dental caries and is a shared risk factor across several NCDs. Limiting the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake  and ideally to less than 5%  minimizes the risk of dental caries throughout the life course. WHO recommends that children under 2 years of age should not consume any sugar-sweetened beverages.

It is prevalent throughout the life course and affects both permanent teeth and deciduous (first) teeth It is estimated that there are 2 billion people with permanent teeth with caries and 510 million children with deciduous teeth with caries. Consumption of free sugars is a major risk factor for overweight, obesity and dental caries. Dental caries can be prevented by avoiding dietary free sugars. Simple and cost-effective interventions are available to help people reduce their sugars consumption, and prevent dental caries. Simple, minimally invasive treatment for caries can be provided in primary health-care settings, without the need of a dental chair or specialist equipment. Severe dental caries can lead to tooth loss and impair quality of life. The consequences of untreated dental caries include: physical symptoms such pain, discomfort or chronic systemic infection; functional limitations such as challenges eating, speaking, breathing or sleeping; and detrimental impacts on emotional, mental and social well-being. Dental caries affects all age groups, and can start with the eruption of the first teeth (deciduous teeth). The condition increases in prevalence in adulthood. In children, dental caries often leads to absence from school. For adults, dental caries is associated with absence from work, and may negatively affect employment opportunities and reduce productivity. In low-income settings, the majority of dental caries goes untreated. Teeth affected by caries are often extracted (pulled out) when they cause pain or infection. Prevention and treatment for dental caries is usually not part of national health benefit packages. This often leads to catastrophic costs and significant financial burden for families and communities. Improving integration of oral health care services in primary health care and health benefit packages would improve access to prevention and management of oral diseases that better respond to the needs of populations. The total direct expenditure for oral diseases among WHOs 194 Member States amounted to US 387 billion or a global average of about US 50 per capita in 2019. This represents about 4.8% of global direct health expenditures. At the same time, productivity losses from oral diseases were estimated at about US 42 per capita, totaling around US 323 billion globally..",

Tetanus cannot be transmitted from person to person. Tetanus can be prevented through immunization with tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines (TTCV). However, people who recover from tetanus do not have natural immunity and can be infected again. The majority of reported tetanus cases are birth-associated among newborn babies and mothers who have not been sufficiently vaccinated with TTCV. In 2018, about 25 000 newborns died from neonatal tetanus, a 97% reduction since 1988, largely due to scaled-up immunization with TTCV.

The spores are found everywhere in the environment, particularly in soil, ash, intestinal tractsfeces of animals and humans, and on the surfaces of skin and rusty tools like nails, needles, barbed wire, etc. Being very resistant to heat and most antiseptics, the spores can survive for years. Anyone can get tetanus, but the disease is particularly common and serious in newborn babies and pregnant women who have not been sufficiently immunized with tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines. Tetanus during pregnancy or within 6 weeks of the end of pregnancy is called maternal tetanus, and tetanus within the first 28 days of life is called neonatal tetanus. The disease remains an important public health problem in many parts of the world, but especially in low-income countries or districts, where immunization coverage is low, and unclean birth practices are common. Neonatal tetanus occurs when nonsterile instruments are used to cut the umbilical cord or when contaminated material is used to cover the umbilical stump. Deliveries carried out by people with unclean hands or on a contaminated surface are also risk factors. In 2018, approximately 25 000 newborns died from neonatal tetanus, a 97% reduction from 1988 when an estimated 787 000 newborn babies died of tetanus within their first month of life. However, there is increased risk of tetanus in adolescent and adult males who undergo circumcision due to waning immunity and limited opportunity for receiving booster doses in males in many countries..",

In neonatal tetanus, symptoms include muscle spasms, which are often preceded by the newborns inability to suck or breastfeed, and excessive crying. Tetanus is diagnosed on the basis of clinical features and does not require laboratory confirmation. The WHO definition of a confirmed neonatal tetanus case is an illness occurring in an infant who has the normal ability to suck and cry in the first 2 days of life, but who loses this ability between days 3 and 28 of life and becomes rigid or has spasms. The WHO definition of non-neonatal tetanus requires at least one of the following signs: a sustained spasm of the facial muscles in which the person appears to be grinning, or painful muscular contractions. Although this definition requires a history of injury or wound, tetanus may also occur in patients who are unable to recall a specific wound or injury..",

Infection becomes less frequent and shorter in duration with increasing age. Infection is usually acquired when living in close proximity to others with active disease, and the family is the main setting for transmission. An individuals immune system can clear a single episode of infection, but in endemic communities re-acquisition of the organism occurs frequently. After years of repeated infection, the inside of the eyelid can become so severely scarred (trachomatous conjunctival scarring) that it turns inwards and causes the eyelashes to rub against the eyeball (trachomatous trichiasis), resulting in constant pain and light intolerance. This and other alterations of the eye can lead to scarring of the cornea. Left untreated, this condition leads to the formation of irreversible opacities, with resulting visual impairment or blindness. The age at which this occurs depends on several factors including local transmission intensity. In very highly endemic communities it can occur in childhood, though onset of visual impairment between the ages of 30 and 40 years is more typical. Visual impairment or blindness results in a worsening of the life experience of affected individuals and their families, who are normally already amongst the poorest of the poor. Women are blinded up to 4 times as often as men, probably due to their close contact with infected children and their resulting greater frequency of infection episodes. Environmental factors associated with more intense transmission ofC. trachomatisinclude: inadequate hygiene crowded households inadequate access to water inadequate access to and use of sanitation..",

Sustained control efforts have reduced the number of new cases by 97% in the last 20 years. Diagnosis and treatment are complex and require specific skills..",

It is caused by protozoans of the genusTrypanosoma, transmitted to humans by bites of tsetse flies (glossina) which have acquired the parasites from infected humans or animals. Tsetse flies inhabit sub-Saharan Africa and only certain species transmit the disease. Rural populations which depend on agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry or hunting are the most exposed. In many regions where tsetse flies are found, HAT is not. The disease has a focal distribution ranging from single villages to entire regions, and the incidence can vary from one village to the next..",

Other possible transmission ways are: mother-to-child: trypanosomes can cross the placenta and infect the fetus; mechanical transmission by other blood-sucking insects is possible, although its epidemiological impact is likely marginal; accidental infection in laboratories via pricks with contaminated needles; and transmission through sexual contact has been reported once. Initially the trypanosomes multiply in subcutaneous tissue, blood and lymph. This is called haemo-lymphatic or first stage, which entails bouts of fever, headache, enlarged lymph nodes, joint pains and itching. Later the parasites cross the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system causing the meningo-encephalitic or second stage. Generally this is when more obvious signs and symptoms of HAT appear: behaviour changes, confusion, sensory disturbances and poor coordination. Sleep cycle disturbance, which gives the disease its name, is a prominent feature. Without treatment, HAT is usually fatal although rare cases of self-cure have been reported..",

The assessment of treatment outcome requires follow up for up to 24 months with clinical assessment and laboratory exams including sometimes of cerebrospinal fluid, because parasites may remain viable and reproduce the disease many months after treatment. Treatment in the second stage requires drugs that cross the bloodbrain barrier. All anti-trypanosomals are donated to WHO by the manufacturers and distributed for free to endemic countries. NewWHO treatment guidelinesfor gambiense-HAT were issued in 2019. Six drugs are used: In gambiense-HAT Pentamidine, intramuscular: in first stage, generally well tolerated by patients. Eflornithine, intravenous: much safer than melarsoprol, only effective in gambiense-HAT. It is generally co-administered with nifurtimox (Nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy, NECT) but can be used also as monotherapy. The administration is complex. Nifurtimox, oral: in second stage, only as a component of NECT, which is a shorter treatment with four-times fewer eflornithine infusions, safer and more effective than eflornithine alone. WHO supplies NECT free of charge to endemic countries in a kit containing all the material needed for its administration. Fexinidazole, oral: in first stage and non-severe second stage. To ensure efficacy, intake after a solid meal and under supervision of trained medical staff is required. In rhodesiense-HAT Suramin, intravenous: in first stage. May provoke adverse effects including nephrotoxicity and allergic reactions. Melarsoprol, intravenous: in second stage. An arsenic derivate, it has many adverse effects, the most dramatic being the reactive encephalopathy which is 310% fatal..",

Most affected individuals attempt to extract the fleas, leaving a typical circular lesion, often with the blackened remains of the dead flea. This is a clear indication of recent infection. The acute and chronic morbidity associated with tungiasis results from an inflammatory reaction around embedded female sand fleas, exacerbated by bacterial superinfection. During the acute phase, erythema, oedema, desquamation, pain and itching are constant. Itching induces scratching of the lesion, which in turn facilitates bacterial superinfection. Abscesses, sometimes large, are common. The feet are the most common infection point but infestation can occur in all parts of the body. Bullous-type lesions have also been reported. Fissures, ulcers, lymphangitis, lymphoedema, ascending neuritis, deformation and loss of nails, and tissue necrosis are chronic complications.

While some people are exposed to artificial UVR sources (e.g. in medicine, industry and for disinfection and cosmetic purposes), everyone is exposed to solar UVR. Solar UVR levels are influenced by several factors: Sun elevation: the higher the sun in the sky, the higher the UVR level. UVR levels vary with time of day and time of year. Latitude: the closer to the equator, the higher the UVR levels. Altitude: UVR levels increase with altitude as the air is thinner and less UVR is absorbed. Cloud cover: UVR levels are highest under cloudless skies but can be high even with cloud cover. Ozone: ozone absorbs part of the UVR from the sun. Less ozone means more UVR reaches the Earths surface. Reflection: reflective surfaces, such as water, sand and fresh snow, increase the UVR level. Climate change, including through variations in ozone and cloud cover, is expected to impact UVR levels at the Earths surface..",

Improvements to health services coverage have stagnated since 2015, and the proportion of the population that faced catastrophic levels of out-of-pocket health spending increased continuously since 2000. This global pattern is consistent across all regions and the majority of countries. The UHC service coverage index increased from 45 to 68 between 2000 and 2021. However, recent progress in increasing coverage has slowed compared to pre-2015 gains, rising only 3 index points between 2015 and 2021 and showing no change since 2019. The proportion of the population not covered by essential health services decreased by about 15% between 2000 and 2021, with minimal progress made after 2015. This indicates that in 2021, about 4.5 billion people were not fully covered by essential health services. About 2 billion people are facing financial hardship including 1 billion experiencing catastrophic out-of-pocket health spending (SDG indicator 3.8.2) or 344 million people going deeper into extreme poverty due to health costs. The COVID-19 pandemic further disrupted essential services in 92% of countries at the height of the pandemic in 2021. In 2022, 84% of countries still reported disruptions. To build back better, WHOs recommendation is to reorient health systems using a primary health care (PHC) approach. Scaling up PHC interventions across low and middle-income countries could save 60 million lives and increase average life expectancy by 3.7 years by 2030..",

It covers the full continuum of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care across the life course. The delivery of these services requires health and care workers with an optimal skills mix at all levels of the health system, who are equitably distributed, adequately supported with access to quality assured products, and enjoying decent work. Protecting people from the financial consequences of paying for health services out of their own pockets reduces the risk that people will be pushed into poverty because the cost of needed services and treatments requires them to use up their life savings, sell assets, or borrow  destroying their futures and often those of their children. Achieving UHC is one of the targets the nations of the world set when they adopted the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. At the United Nations General Assembly High Level Meeting on UHC in 2019, countries reaffirmed that health is a precondition for and an outcome and indicator of the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.

As such, violence against children can negatively affect cognitive development and results in educational and vocational under-achievement. Result in negative coping and health risk behaviours.Children exposed to violence and other adversities are substantially more likely to smoke, misuse alcohol and drugs, and engage in high-risk sexual behaviour. They also have higher rates of anxiety, depression, other mental health problems and suicide. Lead to unintended pregnancies, induced abortions, gynaecological problems, and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.

White phosphorus is used for military purposes in grenades and artillery shells to produce illumination, to generate a smokescreen and as an incendiary. Its major industrial uses are in the production of phosphoric acid, phosphates and other compounds. Phosphates are used to manufacture a range of products including fertilizers and detergents. Phosphorus has been used as a rodenticide and in fireworks..",

From the 1960s to 1980s, sporadic human infections were detected across Africa and Asia. However, since 2007 outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific. In outbreaks over the last decade Zika virus infection was found to be associated with increased incidence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. When Zika virus emerged in the Americas, with a large epidemic in Brazil in 2015, an association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly (smaller than normal head size) was first described; there were similar findings in French Polynesia upon retrospective review. From February to November 2016, WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) regarding microcephaly, other neurological disorders and Zika virus, and the causal link between Zika virus and congenital malformations was soon confirmed(1,2). Outbreaks of Zika virus disease were identified throughout most of the Americas and in other regions with establishedAedes aegyptimosquitos. Infections were detected in travellers from active transmission areas and sexual transmission was confirmed as an alternate route of Zika virus infection. Cases of Zika virus disease globally declined from 2017 onwards; however, Zika virus transmission persists at low levels in several countries in the Americas and in other endemic regions. In addition, the first local mosquito-transmitted Zika virus disease cases were reported in Europe in 2019 and Zika virus outbreak activity was detected in India in 2021. To date, a total of 89 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito transmitted Zika virus infection; however, surveillance remains limited globally.
